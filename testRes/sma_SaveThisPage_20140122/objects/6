<p>Workaholism is often confused with hard work. Some people who work on the Web seem not only to disregard its dangers, but to actively promote it. They see it as a badge of honor&mdash;but is it really? On the contrary, it’s a serious issue that can damage Web teams.</p>
<p>Before we get started, <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201203/workaholism-and-the-myth-hard-work">let’s make one thing clear</a>: A &#8220;workaholic&#8221; is someone who is <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-workaholics/201112/understanding-the-dynamics-workaholism">addicted</a> to work, someone who is out of balance and out of control. Their addiction can make them work for 12, 14 or even more hours a day, every day. No weekends, no vacations, just work. Soon, they neglect their family, friends, health, sometimes damaging them all irrevocably.</p>
<p>In contrast, people who simply &#8220;work hard&#8221; do not expose themselves to such dangers. Putting in a few extra hours to meet a critical deadline doesn’t usually result in workaholism, provided that those sprints are rare and justified.</p>
<h3>On Good Web Teams</h3>
<p>Running a modern Web business can be demanding. As a result, some business owners stretch their employees as far as they can. What they fail to realize is that working 40 hours per week is enough. Any more and both the <a href="http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/why-working-more-than-40-hours-a-week-is-useless.html">employees and the business could be harmed</a>, startups included.</p>
<p>Productivity depends <em>not only</em> on working hours, but <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2007/07/26/the-straight-a-gospels-pseudo-work-does-not-equal-work/">on intensity of work</a>. Here’s a magic equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>work accomplished = time spent &#215; intensity of focus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pushing people to work more hours is a <em>superficial</em> solution, not a <em>viable</em> one.</p>
<p>Good teams, winning teams, are fragile ecosystems. Members communicate with each other through different media (face to face, instant messages, email, project management software), and the communication is often asynchronous (thus, accommodating both early birds and night owls, as well as people in other time zones). Once a team finds its pace, that rhythm must be protected.</p>
<p>Members of this fragile ecosystem are connected by invisible bonds of respect and care. <strong>Teams are made up of humans.</strong> You can see this in action on a sports team: When an opponent attacks a member of the team, the rest rush to protect their teammate. That’s team spirit.</p>
<p>Workaholics have a much more extreme approach to work. They work far more than 40 hours per week, they disrupt the rhythm of the team, and they disregard the invisible bonds of care and respect. Just <em>one</em> of them is enough to damage the health of a good team.</p>
<h3>How Does Someone Become A Workaholic?</h3>
<p>Think of the movies that feature a lonely computer programmer, coding non-stop day and night. The character is familiar. But can computers themselves stimulate workaholism? They are, after all, absorbing and entertaining at once. Losing control seems to be a greater danger for us than for other professionals. However, a <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200605/field-guide-the-workaholic">job can’t turn someone into a workaholic</a>. Workaholics tend to be rigid, perfectionist and born achievers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/upto6only/5893812038/sizes/l/"><img alt="workaholic" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/workaholic-opt.jpg" width="500" height="667" /></a><br /><em>“He would waste no hour.” (Image: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/upto6only/">Iana Peralta</a>)</em></p>
<p>Workaholics have a characteristic that distinguishes them from people who just love their work: <a href="http://www.careercast.com/career-news/truth-about-workaholics">personal</a> <a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/how-overcome-being-workaholic-8450819.html?cat=5">insecurity</a>. Personal insecurity is associated with neuroticism, another inherent characteristic of workaholics, according to the study “<a href="http://folk.uib.no/pspsm/documents/B-M-P-2006.pdf">Personality Correlates of Workaholism</a>” (PDF). Peter E. Mudrack, in his chapter “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nqWvpJ3WKSQC&#038;lpg=PA108&#038;ots=eb4hcoWca4&#038;dq=Mudrack,+E.+(2006).+Understanding+workaholism&#038;lr=&#038;pg=PA108&#038;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false">Understanding Workaholism: The Case for Behavioral Tendencies</a>” for the book <em>Research Companion to Working Time and Work Addiction</em>, connects workaholism to feelings of low self-worth and insecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Insecurity comes in many guises:</strong> low self-esteem, antagonism, authoritarianism, severe fear of failure, perfectionism. The actions of workaholics express an urgent need to prove to themselves and to others that they’re better than everyone else in the room. Deep down, they hurt. Some feel like a failure in their personal life and use their job to escape from a bad relationship or to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/jobs/21career.html?_r=0">make up for an absence in their personal life</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes people become workaholics for less complicated reasons. A big loan or a personal debt are tangible problems. If someone is in desperate need of money, they’ll work as much as they can to get it. Supporting a large family is also a huge burden. Such situations are oppressive and make some people abandon their principles and become workaholics.</p>
<p>In some ways, workaholism is a symptom of modern society. We live in a culture where productivity is paramount and the <a href="http://samvak.tripod.com/leisure.html">boundaries between leisure and work are no longer clear</a>. We’re raising a generation of people who not only love their work but put it at the center of their lives. The entrepreneurial lifestyle is held up as the model of how to work on the Web. Slowly, gradually, we are changing our fundamental values and criteria for success.</p>
<h4>Are You a Workaholic?</h4>
<p>Most workaholics wouldn’t admit that they’re one to themselves, let alone to anyone else. If you’re worried that you might be one, ask yourself a few simple questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Do I work far more than 40 hours per week?”</li>
<li>“Do I feel a continual urge to prove that I’m the best among my colleagues?”</li>
<li>“Do I recognize signs of intense insecurity in myself about work?”</li>
<li>“Are my personal and work lives balanced?”</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s even an <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2011/05/living/workaholic.test/">online quiz</a> that could help you. It’s simple and short.</p>
<p>You could bury your head in the sand and pretend that everything is OK. But if you suspect that you’re a workaholic, then doing something about it is critical. And if you still think workaholism is cool, please keep on reading.</p>
<h3>The Attractiveness Of Workaholics</h3>
<p>Yes, some employers love workaholics. But why are workaholics so appealing?</p>
<ul>
<li>They work longer hours than the rest of the team.</li>
<li>They don’t mind taking work home.</li>
<li>Outworking everyone else makes them seem like they care. Always taking on responsibility and being at work all of the time make them look valuable. And carrying on under any circumstance makes them a fighter.</li>
</ul>
<p>They know what employers want, and they’re eager to give it.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at two archetypal workaholics.</p>
<h4>1. The Committed Lead Programmer</h4>
<p>Upon conducting extensive research, an experienced lead programmer comes up with a number of different database implementations to apply to a Web project. He decides to test each one thoroughly to find the best one. This doesn’t impinge on anyone’s time except his own. He <strong>decides to take the job home</strong> and works day and night to accomplish the task. He knows it won’t be easy, but he’s committed. All he wants is to be appreciated for his dedication and work.</p>
<p>Pretty compelling, right? A meticulous Web worker who sacrifices his personal time to advance the project.</p>
<h4>2. The Project Manager With Mettle</h4>
<p>In a casual company meeting, a project manager promises stakeholders a sophisticated implementation of a service on an incredibly tight schedule. He’s not afraid to take responsibility for the project, and he promises to check every single aspect of it personally. If that requires him to <strong>push the team as far as he can</strong>, then so be it.</p>
<p>Stakeholders leave the meeting impressed by his loyalty and determination. At last, they have found someone they can count on.</p>
<p>The characters above are just a couple of the types of workaholics in our industry. There are many: the superstar designer who’s willing to present multiple design directions; the perfectionist developer who insists on flawless code, even sacrificing his summer vacations. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Such people look much more attractive than their coworkers who stick to eight-hour workdays. They have charisma, they work hard, and they should be praised, if not promoted.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fboyd/3793181882/"><img alt="office-night" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/office-night-opt.jpg" width="500" height="500" /></a><br /><em>“Office hours” are sometimes relative. (Image: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fboyd/3793181882/">Florian Boyd</a>)</em></p>
<h3>The Fake Glow Of Workaholism</h3>
<p>The glow of this perfectionism is false. These practices are only temporarily fruitful, and they can eventually result in disaster. The reason is that workaholism is a shortsighted strategy, one that encourages people to express the worst parts of their personality.</p>
<p>Why is it shortsighted? Because the committed programmer cited above is unconsciously hurting his team’s spirit. As <a href="http://scottberkun.com/essays/47-teams-and-stars/">Scott Berkun notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Simply outworking other people can have a negative effect on others: that 5&#215; improvement may create a -2&#215; impact on everyone else: if the star demoralizes others and goes out of his way to embarrasses them with his talent, morale and productivity are sure to drop.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, even the most productive employees can’t keep working with such intensity for long. They will eventually wear out, as will their ability to think clearly. They will no longer be able to contribute to the team or make sound decisions. A successful team needs steady performance from its members more than heroic efforts. A member who temporarily outworks the rest of the team soon becomes an obstacle because they can’t work as part of the team, despite their best intentions.</p>
<p>And <strong>why does workaholism lead people to show the dark side of their personality?</strong> Let’s return to our second character type. The project manager who would do anything to keep his promise will end up creating too much tension by pushing the team members to their limit. Even if he pushes himself more, he will not inspire anyone; he will merely be a foolish dictator &mdash; not a member of the team, but an opponent.</p>
<p>When a team struggles to cope with an impossible project and infighting occurs, the incredible pressure will reduce the overall quality of the work. In such an environment, the manager could very easily get someone out of their way by derailing them, <a href="https://medium.com/about-work/65d4740f7a2f">as Shanley explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Any disagreement or critique is transformed into a symptom of pathology on the part of the dissenter. Managers may imply that the individual is unstable, emotionally disturbed, or has a mental disorder. Commonly, this includes overtly stating or implying that the dissenter is “too emotional,” should “take some time off,” “has an anger problem,” is “hostile,” is “overly aggressive,” “takes things too seriously/personally” or “has a problem with authority.”&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the best case scenario, the workaholic will end up exhausted, needing weeks or even months to recover. In the worst case scenario, the team will derail and the members will be dispirited.</p>
<h3>Workaholic Companies</h3>
<p>Too many workaholic companies are out there, and it’s pretty easy for an employer to create one. All the employer has to do is push people to work beyond their limit and punish the ones who don’t. Big companies such as McKinsey have <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1993/11/01/78550/index.htm">have sought out such people</a>, according to CNN.</p>
<p>Workaholic companies are machines that burn people out. They don’t care about creating teams. They exploit the enthusiasm of young people and dry them up. One indicator of a workaholic company is that its contractors rarely stay with it for more than a few years.</p>
<p>There are other ways to identify workaholic companies. A few people proudly call themselves workaholics, but most people don’t boast about it, and spotting one from the outside can be hard. However, they can be identified. Before entering a new work environment, <strong>search for the “local heroes”</strong> &mdash; the people who urge everyone else to work more, who can’t have a good laugh during working hours or who constantly talk about “the good of the company.” Can you find the individuals who, beyond a doubt, elicit unpleasant feelings from the rest of the team? They are the ones to watch out for.</p>
<p>Go on. Don’t be afraid to ask straight questions of potential employers during interviews. They may respond vaguely, but try to get crystal clear answers. Some employers expect you to be as dedicated as them, to put yourself in their shoes. Or they will tell you that the company is now your home and that you should do whatever it takes to make it thrive. If you hear these words, run away!</p>
<p>Remember that you work for money, but money alone is not enough. A job is also about <a href="http://www.cvrdallas.com/hughes-view.html">being satisfied</a>, which comes from an effective management style, good use of the team’s various skills and a pleasant atmosphere. A workaholic company needs you more than you need it. You deserve better.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/about-work/65d4740f7a2f"><img alt="Working With Workaholics" title="Working With Workaholics" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/working-with-workaholics.png" width="500" height="382" /></a><br /><em>Workaholics tend to lose track of time &mdash; voluntarily or involuntarily. (Image credit: &#8220;<a href="https://medium.com/about-work/65d4740f7a2f">Microaggression and Management</a>&#8220;.)</em></p>
<h3>Working With Workaholics</h3>
<p>An environment where workaholism is the norm soon gets frustrating. You will quickly find yourself with two choices: follow the others or stand your ground and work according to your own conscience.</p>
<p>The first option is an admission of defeat. You’re saying, “I won’t try to change the situation here because, if I do so, my job will be at risk.” While no one would blame you for taking this route, you will wither day by day, dying a slow death.</p>
<p>The second option brings its own problems. You must <strong>be prepared to fight for your right to work normally</strong>. Remain calm, patient and diligent, while questioning everything. You could raise the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is performance measured?</li>
<li>Why are deadlines so harsh?</li>
<li>Who is ultimately responsible, and what happens when things go wrong?</li>
<li>What are the procedures for making complaints?</li>
<li>What is the past and future of the company?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do find yourself in a workaholic company, the first thing to do is keep sane and keep working. Try to find out why things have gone wrong. Ask questions in front of others so that they feel empowered to ask questions, too. Workaholism affects everyone, but not everyone feels free to speak up. If you never talk about it, no one will help you.</p>
<p>If the culture of the company as a whole promotes workaholism, then your employer might not be happy with you for pointing it out. Your employer might think that someone who works eight hours a day doesn’t work enough and will tempt others to work less. It’s not going to be easy, but it is worth the effort. If you can demonstrate that workaholism is destructive, then you’ll gradually change the culture of the company, a huge win.</p>
<h3>Fighting Workaholism</h3>
<p>Modern businesses need <em>strong teams</em>, not <em>overworked individuals</em>. They need healthy environments, with people who care as much for their teammates as they do for their products.</p>
<p>Fighting workaholism is not easy, but it <em>can</em> be done. How?</p>
<ul>
<li>Be eager to reject workaholism. Every. Single. Day.</li>
<li>Learn to recognize workaholics.</li>
<li>Avoid workaholic companies. You won’t regret it.</li>
<li>If you are at a workaholic company now, end your workday at a reasonable time, or suffer the consequences.</li>
<li>Spread the word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Employers are responsible for workaholism, but if Web workers reject workaholic companies, then those employers would have to change their ways.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re saying, “What if I’m the employer?”</p>
<p>It’s simple, really. By now, you must have realized that promoting workaholism won’t take you far. So, <strong>stand up, leave your desk and see if any workaholics are destroying your fragile ecosystem.</strong> Help them to bring balance back to their life. And if that doesn’t work, then do as the smart folks say: <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/902-fire-the-workaholics">fire the workaholic</a>!</p>

<p>Welcome to another interview in the <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/jacob-cook/?rel=author">“How I Work” series</a>. These interviews reveal how leading thinkers and creators on the Web design, code and create. The goal is not to get into the nuances of their craft (that information exists elsewhere online), but rather to step back and learn a bit about their habits, philosophies and workflow for producing great work.</p>
<p>This time, we’re speaking with Andres Glusman, of <a href="http://meetup.com">Meetup</a>, a company that uses the efficiency of the Internet to conveniently connect people offline. Andres works as the VP of Strategy, Product and Community in Meetup’s New York City office. In this piece, he shares with us how the company uses User Experience (UX), Lean Startup methods and innovative ways of organizing interdisciplinary teams to fuel the company’s consistent growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Andres-Glusman-large-opt_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Andres-Glusman-opt_mini.jpg" alt="Andres-Glusman-opt_mini" width="500" height="614" /></a><br/><em>Andres Glusman loves meeting users and hearing them say, “Meetup changed my life.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you first get into the Web?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> I got into the Web in the mid-&#8217;90s. I was in strategy at Boeing and got excited about the future of how people would find things online. I discovered this company called i-traffic. It was one of the world’s first interactive agencies. I was inspired by its approach, so I packed up, moved cross-country and took an entry-level job. I worked my tail off and got the opportunity to eventually lead a division. A few years later, when i-traffic’s CEO moved on to start <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a>, he called me up to invite me to be a cofounder. I had just gotten into Wharton, so I said “Thanks, but no thanks.”</p>
<p>I did do a little consulting before heading back to school. In fact, I made our first $14 of revenue. After business school I got sucked back in and have been at Meetup for nine years now. I currently oversee three teams: Product, Strategy and Community.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Because you manage product, strategy and community, how do you impart a user-first approach?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> It’s easy to be member-centric at a mission-driven organization. Meetups change lives in profound ways, and people who work here are passionate about the impact we can have on the world by sparking meetups everywhere. In that context, experience is everything.</p>
<p>It also helps that the way we work actively exposes us to how people actually use the stuff we build. That keeps us pretty centered. We start with a vision and often a make simple prototype of the experience we want to foster. We run it through our in-house usability lab and iterate rapidly until we’ve got something we like. Then, we carve it up into experiments that we run on the live site.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/meetup-hq-large-opt_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/meetup-hq-opt_mini.jpg" alt="meetup-hq-opt_mini" width="500" height="297" /></a><br/><em>A sneak peek inside the Meetup headquarters.</em></p>
<p>The people who work here love the fact that they can get super-fast feedback from members. We do 400+ tests a year. So, folks on our team can get feedback often within an hour or two.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you walk us through how Meetup iterates on the product?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> Sure. Why don’t I tell you the story of how we revamped an important experience on Meetup, to illustrate how we work? We used to have a Meetup Group creation experience that had all the charm and excitement of a tax form. We looked at data to see where people fell off and did usability tests to understand how people experienced it and why they struggled.</p>
<p>One night, we had an informal brainstorm about what the experience could be like. The product designer involved went home, got inspired and came in the next day with a prototype of a radically different experience he’d hacked. It looked like <a href="http://glusman.com/leanexample/start.html">this</a>. It was completely divorced from our code base, and it was really fun. We had someone coming in for usability an hour later. So, we dropped it into testing, watched from our desks and quickly learned two things. One, we heard things like “Oooh,” “Ahhh” and “That’s cool.” So, we knew we were onto something.</p>
<p>But they were also thoroughly confused by the flow of the experience. So, we scrapped 90% of the prototype, kept the interaction piece and iterated on it daily for a week or so until we got to something that worked well. It looked like <a href="http://specialsnowflake.com/mugstart/">this</a>. We then carved it into a series of experiments, which we rolled out to the live site. In the process, we validated our assumptions, discovered which parts made a difference and, ultimately, saw a nice boost in results. The final product can be found online:</p>
<p><a href="https://secure.meetup.com/create/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/meetup-front-page-opt.png" width="500" height="334" alt="" title="" /></a><br/><em>After days of analysing user data and testing, <a href="https://secure.meetup.com/create/">Meetup.com</a> finally got a fresh new look that folks out there found friendly and easy to use.</em></p>
<p>Not every project follows that workflow, but we’ve tried to replicate it as much as possible. That’s why designers are such an important part of our team now. We’ve since grown to three product designers, and building out the design team is our top priority.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does Meetup organize teams and ship?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> We organize ourselves into small cross-functional teams that each addresses a high-priority user experience. For example, there is a team for onboarding new members, called “First Five Minutes.” They look at how the experience should unfold for new members. How do we set up new members to have a great experience? How do we make the experience feel fun and rewarding.</p>
<p>The teams consist of a product manager, front- and back-end developers, QA, and a community manager to represent what we’re seeing in support. Designers play a key role as well, but they work across teams. Designers are super-involved up front in working with teams to shape a vision. They then stay involved to help teams nail the important details. This is having a profound impact on what we build. We’ve still got a lot we want to do, but you can get a glimpse of it in our <a href="http://meetup.com/find">discovery experience</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/find/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/find-meetup-opt.png" alt="Find Your People" title="Find Your People" width="500" height="392" /></a><br/><em>Meetup lets you find &#8220;your&#8221; people, i.e. meeting people with common interests.</em></p>
<p>We have teams focused on lanes like “First Five Minutes,” “Discovery,” “Before/During/After the Meetup” and “Meetup Organizers.” They craft a series of visions that they want to pursue. Then, they carve those visions up into these experiments and start working towards a vision of the product that they are all excited to work on. So, these teams essentially function as startups within the company.</p>
<p>In terms of building, we’re agile but not rigidly agile. We don’t have the Scrum masters and the burn boxes thing going on, but we do work iteratively and push code multiple times a day. There are opportunities to iterate on things every day.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can employees switch teams?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> Absolutely, and it doesn’t have to be a permanent switch either. There are times when certain teams have more demand or slack, so people can bounce between teams. And there are times when someone’s interests change. Our team is growing pretty quickly right now, so it’s really not hard for someone to switch teams.</p>
<p><strong>Q: As VP of Strategy (and other things), how do you define and set a strategy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> I like how Michael Porter defines it:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>“Strategy is what you don’t do.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are so many things we want to work on and explore. Our challenge is to say “No” to most things, so that we can say “Yes” to the few that are most important. Right now, we’re focused on building out a beautiful mobile experience and using that as inspiration to transform the desktop experience. We’ve got a pretty ambitious list that we want to get done for the end of the year.</p>
<p>While that’s all going on, I’m starting to think about what 2014 and 2015 will look like. We want to make sure we’re planning ahead and hiring the right kind of people now to pursue these really big ideas next year.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s your take on network effects and user experience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> Network effects are one of the most powerful dynamics in our industry. You will generally find that, where network effects exist, the more people are using a platform, the more valuable it is to everyone. There are multiple kinds of networks. There are two-sided marketplaces, like a Craigslist or eBay, with buyers and sellers. There are one-sided networks, like a fax machine, where everyone can interact with everyone.</p>
<p>But the value of Craigslist is obviously the network. It’s not the most elegant-looking platform, but it delivers you the person who wants to buy your couch in under 45 minutes better than anything else out there. Many people have created clones that are prettier, but without the network, they are nothing. Obviously, strong network effects and delivering a magical user experience win.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you talk a bit about acquiring users in this context, as it relates to Meetup?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> Meetup is a two-sided network. Meetups on the network attract members. Members on the network also attract organizers to start new meetups. That, in turn, attracts more members, which attract more meetups. And so on and so on. It’s a virtuous cycle that we call the Meetup flywheel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: And what have you observed firsthand as a result?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> Well, what is interesting about us is that one of the biggest byproducts of our network effects is a phenomenon we call “spawning,” whereby, as groups grow larger and larger, they then spawn similar but slightly different groups. For example, a motorcycle Meetup group will start in a city. They eventually might spawn a women’s motorcycle rider Meetup. They then might spawn a women’s motorcycle Meetup group for women who work in tech.</p>
<p>So, we’ve discovered that there’s a massive long tail that arises in Meetup communities. If you look at the tech Meetup groups <a href="http://www.meetup.com/find/?categories=34&amp;radius=25&amp;userFreeform=New+York+City%2C+New+York%2C+USA&amp;mcId=c10001&amp;sort=default">here in New York</a>, there is an unbelievable amount of diverse Meetups around different tech areas. This happens because we’re a network.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you manage your day-to-day work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> My job is completely exhilarating because I get to tackle a huge variety of problems. However, the constant sudden shifts between different areas can be a little exhausting. In the morning, I put my daughter on the school bus, then spend 15 minutes outlining priorities for the day. I have an hour commute, so I’ll dedicate that time to working on something very creative, when I tend to have a lot of energy.</p>
<p>Then, I come into work and try to be a sounding board or coach with the different teams (strategy, product and community). I usually don’t hit my email till 5:00 at night. But every so often, I try to block a four-hour chunk of time and sneak off to a conference room somewhere and work on some heavy lifting for creative or analytical projects.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s the best part?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> The two best parts are working with designers and watching usability tests. When I work with a designer, I catch a vision of Meetup’s future. That’s super-inspiring. On the flip side, when I watch a usability test, I get grounded in reality and am surprised by how humans actually behave (as opposed to how I wish they’d behave).</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/meetup-quiet-opt_mini.jpg" alt="meetup-quiet-opt_mini" width="500" height="349" /></a><br/><em>More than 400 usability tests are run through Meetup&#8217;s in-house usability lab every year.</em></p>
<p>Watching usability tests is just such a joy for me, and I don’t get to do it as much as I would like anymore. But when I do get to watch usability testing and see somebody go through an experience, it causes me to look at our experience through fresh eyes. I love putting myself in the user’s shoes and riffing on their experience. I find that so energizing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What excites you most about the Web today?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> The biggest thing is that I don’t feel like we have found the answer to the right way of doing things across this entire industry. Everything could be done better. However, I feel like we’re hitting upon a pretty good way of working at Meetup, which is producing some good results. But in terms of how people come together and build a successful product for the Web or mobile, I think that’s a pretty tough riddle and also a pretty exciting challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Q: And what’s been the best part of Meetup so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andres:</strong> I love meeting our users and hearing them say, “Meetup changed my life.” Every time I go to a conference, somebody will come up to me and say “Meetup changed my life.” They say things like, ”I got into iPhone development because I went to a Meetup,” or something like that. So, the work itself is rewarding, and the problems we get to solve are pretty significant.</p>
<p>Scott (the founder) always says:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>“You haven’t met all of the most important people in your life yet.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Hopefully, we can help make that happen.</p>

<p>The value you bring to any project as a designer or user experience professional isn’t <em>only</em> your ability to execute a series of tasks. Good clients will recognize and appreciate the guidance, recommendations and opinions that come with your experience. <strong>It’s up to you to be forthcoming</strong> and to position yourself as a valuable thinker from the start.</p>
<p>It’s also up to you to base your recommendations on more than subjective opinion. This is especially true in the rapidly evolving world of mobile, where clients typically require as much education as they do execution.</p>
<p>Project-specific research provides the dual benefit of enhancing your general knowledge while improving your ability to make (and sell) decisions as the project progresses. In my experience, gaining that critical buy-in is much easier when recommendations are based on research conducted for the project.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll refer to specific mobile research projects I’ve conducted and build a case for audience surveys, participatory discovery sessions and review of analytics data.</p>
<h3>Practicality Vs. Personality</h3>
<p>A <a title="Finding the Right Job for Your Product" href="http://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/tanev/TTMG_5103/Articles/Christensen_Finding_the_right_job_for_your_product_MIT_Sloan_2007.pdf">paper from Carleton University</a> (PDF) suggests that <strong>consumers simply have jobs to do</strong> and seek to employ the best product or service to do it. Applying this thinking to how users interact with mobile websites places more importance on “What do I need to find/do” than on anything related to their demographic. Mobile Web users have jobs to do that aren’t driven by age, gender, education, income, etc. This “practicality” is key to how I approach research.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/tanev/TTMG_5103/Articles/Christensen_Finding_the_right_job_for_your_product_MIT_Sloan_2007.pdf"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/finding-the-right-job-opt.png" alt="finding-the-right-job-opt" width="468" height="509" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-140871" /></a><br />
<em>&#8220;The jobs that customers are trying to get done cannot be deciphered from purchased databases, but rather from watching, participating, writing and thinking.&#8221; (Source of quote and image: <a href="http://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/tanev/TTMG_5103/Articles/Christensen_Finding_the_right_job_for_your_product_MIT_Sloan_2007.pdf">Finding the Right Job For Your Product</a>)</em></p>
<h3>Fitting Research And Analysis Into Your Process</h3>
<p>Mobile research is a considerable value-add that should be baked into your services to the client from the start. It enables you to make better decisions and to inform your client of what their audience expects from a mobile experience.</p>
<p>I recently finished guiding Loyalist College through a research phase that included a mobile component. The project is currently in production and is slated to launch early this year.</p>
<p>In this case, I faced unique challenges when selling the value of the proposed research to my client. Loyalist had already conducted research, but the research was more focused on uncovering general best practices and on clarifying the psychographics and demographics of its customers.</p>
<p><strong>I suggested adding a more practical, goal-oriented research component</strong> (which was ultimately accepted) as a way to help us build a better product. Most of your clients probably understand well <em>who</em> their customers are but lack a solid grasp of <em>what</em> those customers want from a mobile experience.</p>
<h3>Audience Research</h3>
<p>The best way to determine what users expect to find and do in the mobile channel is to ask.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to approach this.</p>
<h4>Participatory Discovery Sessions</h4>
<p>The Loyalist College project included two sessions in which members of the target audience were asked, quite simply, what they expected to find and do, and how these tasks might best be performed on a mobile device. I also asked how many of the participants use a smartphone as their primary computing device. The data collection method in a session like this is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask participants to contribute approximately 10 things they expect to find and/or do when using their mobile device in the context of the products or services provided by your client. Each item should be written on a sticky note.</li>
<li>Collect the sticky notes and arrange them visibly, like on a wall or table.</li>
<li>Ask participants to review all suggestions and place a star or mark on the three responses that they think are most important.</li>
<li>Discuss the starred responses with the group to seek additional information.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Surveys</h4>
<p>I’m working with 3M Canada on a consumer-facing mobile project that consists of multiple phases of research. In partnership with a research firm, we’re using surveys to learn more about how a very specific, targeted set of customers use their smartphones and what the probability is that they’d be interested in using the application we intend to build. We’ll use the results of this survey to define the features that will ultimately make it easier for users to do their job.</p>
<p>Building and distributing surveys are easy using a tool such as Fluid Surveys or Survey Monkey. If the budget is available, my advice is to seek the assistance of a research firm that can help you accurately craft the survey and find the most relevant set of participants. For a project with a tighter budget, you could certainly create, distribute and analyze a survey using a tool such as Fluid Surveys or Survey Monkey.</p>
<p>In my experience, once you’ve defined the purpose of the research initiative, the following are important to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep the questions focused and simple.</strong> Every question should tie back to the goal of the research and be focused on the expectations and habits of mobile users as they relate to the project. Keeping the questions simple lowers or eliminates any barriers to respond.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid open-ended questions.</strong> Whenever possible, pose questions that require respondents to answer yes or no, via multiple choice, or by rating on a scale. Data of this nature is much easier to analyze and allows you to build recommendations based on objective responses, rather than have to attempt to further interpret subjective feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Use incentives.</strong> A survey that I deployed for a project for the Golf Association of Ontario received over 5,000 responses. Our client was kind enough to offer an incentive of entering participants into a draw.</li>
<li><strong>Define your audience well.</strong> Soliciting responses from a general audience can be difficult, and the results are not always accurate. My suggestion is to work with your client to identify an audience (staff, customers, etc.) and to send the survey directly via an email list or other targeted communication channel.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Analytics Review</h3>
<p>Slicing and reviewing analytics data from an existing Web presence can be an effective way to determine what mobile users are doing with the content and features available. For the Loyalist College project, I was interested in a simple report of the most popular content accessed from mobile devices.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, especially when using Google Analytics, that mobile phones and tablets are lumped together in the default “Mobile” group. Because mobile and tablet use cases are typically very different, I like to segment phones explicitly as part of the analysis. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new custom advanced segment by selecting the arrow on the “Audience Overview” landing page.<br />
<a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GAmobile_two.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139674" alt="GAmobile_two" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GAmobile_two.png" width="500" height="350" /></a></li>
<li>Name the new segment (something like “Phones”).<br />
<a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GAmobile_three.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139700" alt="GAmobile_three" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GAmobile_three.png" width="500" height="350" /></a></li>
<li>In the “Technology” section, choose to include mobile traffic and exclude tablet traffic.<br />
<a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GAmobile_one.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139673" alt="GAmobile_one" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GAmobile_one.png" width="500" height="328" /></a></li>
</ol>
<p>You can now analyze the data and <strong>create reports for phones only</strong>.</p>
<p>I recently used this approach in a large project for the Middlesex-London Health Unit. Part of our plan was to consider mobile as the cornerstone of a large Web redesign project and to treat the mobile experience as a priority from the start, rather than an afterthought. With access to the client’s analytics account, I was able to slice the data and reveal the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>On average, the website received 250 mobile visits per day.</li>
<li>The most popular content for mobile users was a health-related game, information on immunization clinics and career opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Armed with information such as this, I was in a much better position not only to recommend how the content should be prioritized for mobile users but also to demonstrate the general importance of including mobile as a foundational element of the website redesign project.</p>
<p>I took a similar approach with the Loyalist project. In addition to identifying the number of mobile visitors and the content priorities of those users, I was able to communicate to my client that visits from mobile devices had doubled from 2012 to 2013.</p>
<h3>Identifying Themes</h3>
<p>Researching the expectations of mobile users has little value until the research is put to use. I like to include a step between research and execution in which I summarize the findings via a series of “themes.” Themes are a familiar concept that <strong>simplify the process of grouping findings together</strong>, while encompassing a number of tactics to be implemented in the project.</p>
<p>The research that I conducted for the Loyalist project revealed the importance of a centralized events calendar, especially on mobile. Using this data, I created a theme called “Events Matter” and outlined the results of the research and what the new mobile experience would do to capitalize on this theme. It’s important to be specific here and let your client know exactly what you think should be done to capitalize on the results of the research.</p>
<p>The themes can be used to create planning materials, like a creative brief, flowcharts or a scope of work document. Recently, I’ve found myself forgoing these components in favor of building visual concepts directly from the themes and spending more time in rapid iteration, as opposed to drawn-out planning.</p>
<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>Mobile is causing the way we interact with the Web to change at an unforgiving pace, a shift that requires guidance from well-informed professionals like you. Your responsibility is not only to produce great work but to <strong>educate and guide your clients</strong> through something that most of them can’t keep up with.</p>
<p>Selling research as part of your process will be more effective if you can show clients specific examples of how you’ve used research in the past. My advice is to bake research into your next project as a value-add for the client. You can keep it simple by taking the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conduct an analytics review, and use the data to support at least one key decision in the project.</li>
<li>Create a brief survey, and ask the client to provide access to it from their existing website. Again, use the results of the survey to support one key decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>Continually build your research practice from project to project by going deeper with your analytics reviews, adding more survey questions, integrating discovery sessions and building complete themes that guide the project in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Research is a fantastic, accessible way to increase your perceived value while helping to shape the future of the Web and ensuring that the software and websites we build <strong>keep pace with users’ ever-advancing expectations</strong>. Businesses value proof and, in my experience, appreciate a conversation that starts with explaining a body of proof before presenting a set of specific recommendations.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will use Magento’s powerful shipping-method code abstraction to create a shipping carrier. We will create two shipping methods that provide a fixed shipping price, allow for free shipping promotions, define logic based on an item’s weight and, finally, make it all configurable in the admin panel.</p>
<p>We will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend the abstract shipping class and implement the required methods.</li>
<li>Make the shipping method configurable in Magento’s admin panel.</li>
<li>Work with promotions to allow for free shipping.</li>
<li>Allow tracking codes to be set against an order.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Before We Start</h3>
<p>This tutorial assumes that <strong>you are familiar with how to create a Magento module</strong>. If you are not, please first refer to an earlier tutorial in this series, “<a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/03/01/basics-creating-magento-module/">The Basics of Creating a Magento Module</a>.” To begin, you will need a Community or Enterprise  installation of Magento, either locally or on a server that you are able to access.</p>
<p>The logic we will implement in this tutorial could be client-specific, so we will implement our module as a “local module” and, therefore, create it in <code>app/code/local</code>. Let’s start by creating the following file structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
app
  - code
    - local
      - SmashingMagazine
        - MyCarrier
          - Model
            - Carrier.php
          - etc
            - config.xml
            - system.xml
  - etc
    - modules
      - SmashingMagazine_MyCarrier.xml</code></pre>
<p>Now we can create <code>SmashingMagazine_MyCarrier.xml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;config&gt;
    &lt;modules&gt;
        &lt;SmashingMagazine_MyCarrier&gt;
            &lt;active&gt;true&lt;/active&gt;
            &lt;codePool&gt;local&lt;/codePool&gt;
            &lt;depends&gt;
                &lt;Mage_Shipping /&gt;
            &lt;/depends&gt;
        &lt;/SmashingMagazine_MyCarrier&gt;
    &lt;/modules&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the dependency on the shipping module. This ensures that our SmashingMagazine MyCarrier module will load after the Mage Shipping module, and it will throw an error if the Mage Shipping module has been disabled.</p>
<h3>Carriers, Methods, Requests And Results</h3>
<p>Before continuing, we should understand the terminology that Magento uses throughout its shipping abstraction. A “carrier” represents a shipping carrier in the sense you would expect (DPD, FedEx, etc.). Each carrier has one or many shipping methods, which contain the carrier code, the carrier title, the method code, the method title, a price to be paid by the customer and a cost of shipping to the retailer (optional).</p>
<p>During the checkout process, <strong>Magento creates a shipping-rate “request” object that contains all of the shipping information</strong>. The request can be used to determine which rates apply. For example, an “express” shipping method might not apply to orders under $10. All applicable rates are then “appended” to a shipping-rate “result” object, which generates a list of methods for the customer to choose from.</p>
<p>The following list names these concepts defined above, along with their representation as Magento classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request<br />

<h3>Extending The Shipping Abstract</h3>
<p>To create our shipping carrier, we need to extend <code>Mage_Shipping_Model_Carrier_Abstract</code>, implement <code>Mage_Shipping_Model_Carrier_Interface</code> and add the required abstract methods.</p>
<p>The <strong>most important method</strong> is <code>collectRates</code>. This is the method that receives a shipping request, appends applicable shipping methods and returns a shipping result.</p>
<p>Copy the following code into <code>app/code/local/SmashingMagazine/MyCarrier/Model/Carrier.php</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
&lt;?php
class SmashingMagazine_MyCarrier_Model_Carrier
    extends Mage_Shipping_Model_Carrier_Abstract
    implements Mage_Shipping_Model_Carrier_Interface
{
    protected $_code = 'smashingmagazine_mycarrier';

    public function collectRates(
        Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Request $request
    )
    {
        return Mage::getModel('shipping/rate_result');
    }

    public function getAllowedMethods()
    {
        return array();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is <strong>the skeleton for a shipping method class</strong>, but it is pretty useless because we have no shipping methods.</p>
<p>Let’s start by hardcoding a method. This method will be called “standard” and have a price of $9.99. For now, we will assume there is no cost to the retailer.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
&lt;?php
class SmashingMagazine_MyCarrier_Model_Carrier
    extends Mage_Shipping_Model_Carrier_Abstract
    implements Mage_Shipping_Model_Carrier_Interface
{
    protected $_code = 'smashingmagazine_mycarrier';
   
    public function collectRates(
        Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Request $request
    )
    {
        $result = Mage::getModel('shipping/rate_result');
        /* @var $result Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Result */
       
        $result-&gt;append($this-&gt;_getStandardShippingRate());
       
        return $result;
    }

    protected function _getStandardShippingRate()
    {
        $rate = Mage::getModel('shipping/rate_result_method');
        /* @var $rate Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Result_Method */
       
        $rate-&gt;setCarrier($this-&gt;_code);
        /**
         * getConfigData(config_key) returns the configuration value for the
         * carriers/[carrier_code]/[config_key]
         */
        $rate-&gt;setCarrierTitle($this-&gt;getConfigData('title'));
       
        $rate-&gt;setMethod('standand');
        $rate-&gt;setMethodTitle('Standard');
       
        $rate-&gt;setPrice(4.99);
        $rate-&gt;setCost(0);
       
        return $rate;
    }
   
    public function getAllowedMethods()
    {
        return array(
            'standard' => 'Standard',
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we are just one step away from a working shipping method &mdash; the module configuration file.</p>
<h4>Module Configuration</h4>
<p>The module configuration has the standard structure (as detailed in “<a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/03/01/basics-creating-magento-module/" title="The Basics Of Creating A Magento Module">The Basics of Creating a Magento Module</a>”). Copy the following into <code>app/code/local/SmashingMagazine/MyCarrier/etc/config.xml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;config&gt;
    &lt;modules&gt;
        &lt;SmashingMagazine_MyCarrier&gt;
            &lt;module&gt;0.0.1&lt;/module&gt;
        &lt;/SmashingMagazine_MyCarrier&gt;
    &lt;/modules&gt;
    &lt;global&gt;
        &lt;models&gt;
            &lt;smashingmagazine_mycarrier&gt;
                &lt;class&gt;SmashingMagazine_MyCarrier_Model&lt;/class&gt;
            &lt;/smashingmagazine_mycarrier&gt;
        &lt;/models&gt;
    &lt;/global&gt;
    &lt;!-- Default configuration --&gt;
    &lt;default&gt;
        &lt;carriers&gt;
            &lt;smashingmagazine_mycarrier&gt;
                &lt;active&gt;1&lt;/active&gt;
                &lt;!--
                     This configuration should not be made visible
                     to the administrator, because it specifies
                     the model to be used for this carrier.
                --&gt;
                &lt;model&gt;smashingmagazine_mycarrier/carrier&lt;/model&gt;
                &lt;!--
                    The title as referenced in the carrier class
                --&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Smashing Magazine Carrier&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;!--
                    The sort order specifies the position that
                    this carrier appears relative to the other
                    carriers available in checkout.
                --&gt;
                &lt;sort_order&gt;10&lt;/sort_order&gt;
                &lt;!--
                    Out of the box, Magento offers shipping
                    carriers the ability to restrict themselves
                    to specific countries. For this configuration
                    option, 0 means allow all countries available,
                    and 1 means allow all countries specified
                    in the country list that we will add later
                    in system.xml
                --&gt;
                &lt;sallowspecific&gt;0&lt;/sallowspecific&gt;
            &lt;/smashingmagazine_mycarrier&gt;
        &lt;/carriers&gt;
    &lt;/default&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This default configuration “registers” the model we have just created as a shipping carrier. As you may know, <strong>Magento merges all of its configuration XML together</strong> and caches the result (if the cache is enabled). When a customer loads the shipping-method list, Magento loops through all of the carriers in the carriers node of the configuration and loads the shipping methods from the models determined by the “active” carriers.</p>
<p>We should now be able to see our shipping method in the checkout.</p>
<h3>Making It Configurable</h3>
<p>We have already specified the default configuration for this module. So, let’s make our module configurable in the admin panel by copying the following into <code>app/code/local/SmashingMagazine/etc/system.xml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

                &lt;smashingmagazine_mycarrier translate="label"&gt;
                    &lt;label&gt;Smashing Magazine Carrier&lt;/label&gt;
                    &lt;frontend_type&gt;text&lt;/frontend_type&gt;
                    &lt;sort_order&gt;2&lt;/sort_order&gt;
                    &lt;show_in_default&gt;1&lt;/show_in_default&gt;
                    &lt;show_in_website&gt;1&lt;/show_in_website&gt;
                    &lt;show_in_store&gt;1&lt;/show_in_store&gt;
                    &lt;fields&gt;
                        &lt;!--
                            The following fields are available
                            to modify in the admin panel.
                            The values are saved in the
                            database.

                            This shipping carrier abstract checks
                            this value to determine whether
                            the carrier should be shown.

                            &lt;label&gt;Enabled&lt;/label&gt;
                            &lt;frontend_type&gt;select&lt;/frontend_type&gt;

                            This value can be used to specify a
                            custom title for our method.
                        --&gt;
                        &lt;title translate="label"&gt;
                            &lt;label&gt;Title&lt;/label&gt;

                            will appear in relative to the
                            other carriers available.

    &lt;/sections&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>These fields are visible in the admin panel by navigating to <code>System &rarr; Configuration &rarr; Shipping Method &rarr; Smashing Magazine Carrier</code>.</p>
<h3>Using Multiple Shipping Methods</h3>
<h4>Express Shipping</h4>
<p>So far, we have added a standard shipping method for the price of $9.99. However, the customer may wish to pay more to receive their order faster. The following code creates a shipping rate with a higher price and different shipping code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
protected function _getExpressShippingRate()
{
    $rate = Mage::getModel('shipping/rate_result_method');
    /* @var $rate Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Result_Method */
    $rate-&gt;setCarrier($this-&gt;_code);
    $rate-&gt;setCarrierTitle($this-&gt;getConfigData('title'));
    $rate-&gt;setMethod('express');
    $rate-&gt;setMethodTitle('Express (Next day)');
    $rate-&gt;setPrice(12.99);
    $rate-&gt;setCost(0);
    return $rate;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To make this shipping rate appear next to the standard rate that we created earlier, we will need to modify the code in the <code>collectRates</code> method to append the new rate. Add the following before the return statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
$result-&gt;append($this-&gt;_getExpressShippingRate());
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, add the shipping method to the allowed methods array in <code>getAllowedMethods</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
public function getAllowedMethods()
{
    return array(
        'standard' => 'Standard',
        'express' => 'Express',
    );
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Free Shipping</h4>
<p>Many websites offer free shipping when a customer spends over a certain amount or satisfies certain conditions. We need to be able to do the same here. In Magento, you can set up a “Shopping Cart Rule.” With it, you can <strong>specify a set of conditions and define actions if those conditions are met</strong>; one of those actions is free shipping.</p>
<p>If free shipping is available for a customer, then the <code>request</code> object will populated with <code>is_free_shipping</code> set to <code>1</code>. We need to check for and handle this possibility in our shipping method. Add the following before the return statement in the <code>collectRates</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
if ($request->getFreeShipping()) {
    /**
     *  If the request has the free shipping flag,
     *  append a free shipping rate to the result.
     */
    $freeShippingRate = $this->_getFreeShippingRate();
    $result->append($freeShippingRate);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Add the following code to <code>app/code/local/SmashingMagazine/MyCarrier/Model/Carrier.php</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
protected function _getFreeShippingRate()
{
    $rate = Mage::getModel('shipping/rate_result_method');
    /* @var $rate Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Result_Method */
    $rate-&gt;setCarrier($this-&gt;_code);
    $rate-&gt;setCarrierTitle($this-&gt;getConfigData('title'));
    $rate-&gt;setMethod('free_shipping');
    $rate-&gt;setMethodTitle('Free Shipping (3 - 5 days)');      
    $rate-&gt;setPrice(0);
    $rate-&gt;setCost(0);
    return $rate;       
}
</code></pre>
<p>Remember to add the method to the allowed methods array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
public function getAllowedMethods()
{
    return array(
        'standard' => 'Standard',
        'express' => 'Express',
        'free_shipping' => 'Free Shipping',
    );
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Taking It A Bit Further</h3>
<h4>Tracking Deliveries</h4>
<p>Tracking numbers may be added to shipments through either the admin panel or an API. But to make our shipping methods visible in the admin panel, we will have to overwrite the <code>isTrackingAvailable</code> method in the abstract to return <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>Add the following method to the end of <code>SmashingMagazine_MyCarrier_Model_Carrier</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
public function isTrackingAvailable()
{
    return true;
}
</code></pre>
<p>You should now see the shipping carriers and methods available in the delivery courier drop-down menu when you try to place a shipment in the admin panel.</p>
<h4>Using the Weight</h4>
<p>Earlier, we added a more expensive express shipping method. But heavier items that require complex shipping arrangements might not be available for next-day delivery. We can check for this using the weight attribute of the request object by wrapping the code that appends the shipping method to the shipping result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
// ...
$expressWeightThreshold =
    $this-&gt;_getConfigData('express_weight_threshold');

$eligibleForExpressDelivery = true;
foreach ($request-&gt;getAllItems() as $_item) {
    if ($_item-&gt;getWeight() &gt; $expressWeightThreshold) {
        $eligibleForExpressDelivery = false;
    }
}         

if ($eligibleForExpressDelivery) {
    $result-&gt;append($this-&gt;_getExpressShippingRate());
}
// ...
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we have added a reference to the configuration. To make this appear in the admin panel, we need to add the following XML to the <code>app/code/local/SmashingMagazine/MyCarrier/etc/system.xml</code> file in the <code>fields</code> node:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;express_weight_threshold translate=&quot;label&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;Express Weight Threshold&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;frontend_type&gt;text&lt;/frontend_type&gt;
    &lt;sort_order&gt;100&lt;/sort_order&gt;

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>With a relatively small amount of code, we have been able to define our own shipping logic that integrates with checkout, the admin panel and even the shopping-cart promotions. You can learn much more about creating shipping modules in Magento by looking at the examples in the core files &mdash; namely, <code>Mage_Usa</code> and <code>Mage_Shipping</code>.</p>
<p>I welcome any questions and would love to hear your feedback in the comments area below.</p>

<p>The Web is awash in content. A recent Moz article reports that <a href="http://moz.com/blog/future-of-content-upcoming-trends-in-2014">92,000 new articles</a> are posted online <em>every day</em>. Companies are spending <a href="http://www.customcontentcouncil.com/news/nearly-44-billion-new-survey-shows-rise-content-marketing-budget">billions on content marketing</a> to enhance credibility, build brand awareness and, especially of late, improve SEO.</p>
<p>Here is what Google has to say about content in its <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en">quality guidelines</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Make pages primarily for users, not for search engines.</li>
<li>Don’t deceive your users.</li>
<li>Avoid tricks intended to improve search engine rankings. A good rule of thumb is whether you’d feel comfortable explaining what you’ve done to a website that competes with you, or to a Google employee. Another useful test is to ask, “Does this help my users? <strong>Would I do this if search engines didn’t exist?</strong>”</li>
<li>Think about what makes your website unique, valuable, or engaging. Make your website stand out from others in your field.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Google has always <em>tried</em> to reward great content with high rankings, but today, thanks to vast improvements in its algorithm, Google is better able to actually <em>do</em> it. Its content quality guidelines are perfectly aligned with what every writer and marketer should aspire to.</p>
<h4>As A Designer, Why Should You Care About Content Quality?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Your brilliant designs will be wasted if they are filled with inferior content.</li>
<li>By developing the ability to evaluate content quality, you are able to provide constructive, difference-making input to other members of the creative team, increasing your value as a designer.</li>
<li>If you are in a project management role, you must know what needs to be fixed, improved and enhanced in the deliverable’s content.</li>
<li>Unless the content meets a high standard of quality, the finished product will undermine rather than enhance credibility, diminish rather than build brand awareness, and damage rather than improve search engine visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining “quality content” is difficult. <strong>A useful approach is to look at the editing process</strong>, because editing is where content theory is translated into cold hard facts. You could argue forever with clients about what constitutes quality content on a theoretical level. But when you break down quality into its specific editorial components, theoretical arguments evaporate.</p>
<p>A sound editing process <em>forces</em> quality into content, no matter how ill-conceived or weakly written the content was in the beginning, assuming it was properly conceived and at least decently written to begin with.</p>

<em>The editing process is more important than most think. (Image credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47691521@N07/5496629643/">opensourceway</a>)</em></p>
<p>This article examines several aspects of content editing. By reading it, you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the editing process works for most forms of online business content, including website pages, infographics, landing pages, brochures, white papers and slide presentations;</li>
<li>what “big picture” issues and technical editing details to get right before publishing;</li>
<li>the different types of editing help you need, and where to find authoritative online resources for DIY editing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Five Types Of Content Editing</h3>
<p>There are various formulas for breaking down editing tasks. For business content, it helps to think about editing as having five specialties.</p>
<h4>1. Substantive Editing</h4>
<p>Substantive editors are mainly concerned with overall cohesion, clarity, accuracy and effectiveness. They look for incomplete or faulty arguments, unsupported assertions, inconsistencies or gaps in the logical flow of the content, and faithfulness to the assignment’s strategic goals.</p>
<h4>2. Copyediting</h4>
<p>Copyeditors are mainly concerned with style. Are sentences clear and concise? Is the tone consistent? Are the right words being used? Is the text free of jargon and obscure references? Does the copy adhere to rules of grammar, punctuation and style?</p>
<h4>3. Fact-Checking</h4>
<p>Fact-checkers are mainly concerned with informational accuracy. They make sure statistics and other quantitative information are stated fully and correctly. Fact-checking is often a research task, but in business writing, it also comes into play at the editing stage &mdash; with vitally important impact, as we will see in a moment.</p>
<h4>4. SEO</h4>
<p>SEO editing ensures that on-page content conforms to SEO best practices and follows the campaign’s on-page guidelines. SEO editing is typically done by a client’s internal or external SEO resource. The more the SEO resource is plugged into the creative process, the less artificial and stilted the optimized content will be.</p>
<h4>5. Proofreading</h4>
<p>Proofreaders are mainly concerned with technical precision. Different standards apply to different types of content; a list of authoritative editing resources appears at the end of this article.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/copyediting-screenshot-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/copyediting-screenshot-500px-opt.png" width="500" height="178" alt="" title="" /></a><br /><em>Editing done here by Johanna Shapiro (<a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/copyediting-screenshot-opt.png">View larger version</a>)</em></p>
<p>If all of these editing tasks are done well, the final product will have the level of quality that readers and search engines desire. In terms of workflow, the editing process follows the order noted above, starting with substantive editing and ending with proofreading. However, as you might imagine, editing is not always linear; documents usually go back and forth between editors and writers as issues are fixed.</p>
<h3>Editing Process FAQs</h3>
<p>Effective editing is not only a matter of knowing what to do; it also requires an understanding of how to manage workflow and communication. Addressing these FAQs at the outset of your next project will help lay the groundwork for not only a better editing process, but a more enjoyable one.</p>
<h4>Do I Need to Hire Five Editors?</h4>
<p>No. A talented editor can cover a lot of the work at an acceptable level for most business content. That being said, the substantive editor must be familiar with the product, industry and audience in question, since the effectiveness of the content hinges on understanding the audience’s mindset and needs. The SEO editor must, of course, know SEO inside and out.</p>
<h4>How Can I Get Copy Approved More Quickly?</h4>
<p>Too much editing can be just as bad as not enough &mdash; some firms review and tweak for so long that the content is outdated by the time they approve it. The substantive editor or project manager is the best defence against perfectionism. They are best equipped to recognize when content should be deemed finished and to explain why to clients and team members.</p>
<h4>How Much Editing Should the Writer Do?</h4>
<p>I would love to hear from the Smashing Magazine community on this one, because it’s a thorny issue. Even writers with a firm grasp of grammar, style and technique submit substandard drafts due to time constraints or lack of familiarity with the subject matter. Competent writers learn as they go, reducing the editorial burden. For example, if a website project requires 60 pages of new content, have the writer start with 10 pages and then give them a careful copyedit and substantive edit. The edits may be numerous at this point, especially if the writer is new to the subject matter. If the next 10 pages come back vastly improved, then you’ll know the writer is catching on.</p>
<h4>What If My Client Doesn’t Care About Editing?</h4>
<p>Clients might not care about content editing as such, but they certainly care about public image, leads and orders. High-quality content impresses Google, which leads to more search engine visibility, which leads to more traffic and more business. High-quality content also reassures prospects, customers and stakeholders that the company is reliable and competent.</p>
<h4>What’s the Best Way to Manage the Editing Process?</h4>
<p>One person, generally the project manager or substantive editor, should coordinate all editorial functions and communication and make final decisions. Creative teams have many editing tools at their disposal, but using good old Track Changes and Comments in Word documents is perhaps the easiest way to start. A big challenge is preventing multiple versions of an in-process document from floating around; implement a clear procedure to avoid this. In my experience, the competence of the manager, rather than the tools, will determine the efficiency of the process.</p>
<h3>Common Editing Issues</h3>
<p>Let’s look at a few specific real-world issues that crop up in business Web copy for each type of editing. These particulars will give you an idea of what to look for if you are doing the editing or looking for an editor or managing the project.</p>
<h4>Substantive Editing Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>Here is an instructive, real-life example of how substantive editing produces clarity. In a recent article about writing for slide presentations, I wrote, “Slide presentations are great for a ‘peeling the onion’ narrative approach.” My editor commented, “What does that mean?” I pondered the issue and realized that I didn’t really know what I meant! After further reflection, I changed it to, “Slide presentations are ideal for storytelling.” Moral of the story: Substantive editors don’t always need to make sweeping changes. Often, just knowing what to look for helps to get it right.</li>
<li>Keeping content on point prevents content creep. Substantive editors remind clients that a landing page need not be a thousand words long to prompt a conversion, nor a website a thousand pages deep to convey the firm’s value proposition.</li>
<li>Substantive editors police all content to maintain consistency of brand messaging.</li>
<li>The company’s branding and positioning strategy, the value proposition of the product and service being marketed and the nature of the target audience will determine the content’s style and tone. The substantive editor must be crystal clear on all of them.</li>
<li>Building on the last point, a substantive editor &mdash; if time, budget and skill allow &mdash; injects personality into flat business content by adding storytelling narratives and stylistic flair that speak powerfully to the target audience.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.duluthtrading.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/duluthtrading.png" width="500" height="452" alt="" title="" /></a><br/><em>When it comes to substantive editing, <a href="http://www.duluthtrading.com/">Duluth Trading Company’s website</a> does this extraordinarily well.</em></p>
<h4>Copyediting Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>Headlines and headings should be descriptive and, in many cases, persuasive. Additionally, proper keyword placement in headlines and headings is important for SEO, so copyeditors and SEO editors must collaborate closely to balance these requirements.</li>
<li>Active voice <em>usually</em> beats passive voice: “John saved $100” has more impact than “$100 was saved by John.” There are cases where the passive voice is preferred; a competent copyeditor makes the proper adjustments.</li>
<li>Pronoun sensitivity leads writers to employ tortuous sentence construction to avoid “he” or “she” usage. Also, writers often shift from “it” to “they” when referring to a company. The copyeditor keeps pronoun use smooth and consistent.</li>
<li>The wrong word or phrase can do worse than make a company look stupid; it can convey a message contrary to the one intended. My list of <a href="http://blog.straightnorth.com/confusing-business-words-and-phrases/">commonly confused business words and phrases</a> is a handy reference.</li>
<li>Overuse of exclamation points and all-caps conveys HYSTERIA!!!!</li>
<li>Copyeditors convert long unformatted paragraphs into Web-optimized formats that employ bullet points, three- to five-line paragraphs, judicious use of bold text, etc. This is an area where designers provide valuable input.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fact-Checking Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sadly, the Web is a stewpot of misinformation, cooked up by marketers who feel pressured to publish. For example, a reader might come across a flashy infographic stating, “70% of Executives Use Tablets!” but, after checking the source, discovers that this “fact” is based on a survey of 25 anonymous respondents conducted by an obscure agency. Fact-checkers protect you and your client from losing credibility as a result of shaky statistics.</li>
<li>Fact-checkers make sure that basic corporate information is correct. The company’s name, job titles and the spelling of employees’ names should always be accurate &mdash; yet often are not.</li>
<li>Fact-checkers review product specifications to make sure they are up to date. The value of this thankless task is appreciated only after, say, a customer orders a $1.5 million printing press that turns out to be 10 feet too long for its production line when it arrives at the plant.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SEO Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>Overusing keyword phrases on a page of content is counterproductive.</li>
<li>Varying keyword phrases generally helps search engine visibility and makes content more readable and less “spammy” for humans.</li>
<li>An SEO editor might opt to add links to the client’s other relevant content on a given page of Web content or a blog post. If done correctly, these related links build the authority of the client’s website.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Proofreading Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>One space after a period is standard.</li>
<li>Capitalization in headlines and headings should consistently follow a predetermined style.</li>
<li>Font size and style should be consistent for text and headers from page to page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>In Conclusion, How Much Editing Is Enough?</h3>
<p>Practical considerations such as deadlines and bandwidth, along with a clear understanding of the audience, will influence how thoroughly a piece of online content should be edited.</p>
<h4>Proofreading</h4>
<p>Generally speaking, readers do not hold blog posts to the same stylistic standard as, say, white papers. However, a blog post directed at an audience of scholars, physicians or attorneys <em>will</em> be held to a higher standard.</p>
<h4>Fact-Checking</h4>
<p>Visual content such as infographics and slide presentations, perhaps because of their formality, seem to carry more weight with readers than blog posts and website pages. For this reason, producers of visual content have a greater obligation to be sure of their facts, all else being equal. Firms undermine their credibility when they publish graphical material loaded with unsupported or misleading facts, whether intentionally or not.</p>
<h4>SEO</h4>
<p>If a firm has an organized SEO marketing program, then on-page SEO is crucial. If not, on-page optimization alone would probably not be enough to have any substantive impact on search visibility.</p>
<h4>Copyediting and Substantive Editing</h4>
<p>As for these, there is never any advantage to publishing vague, incoherent and uninspiring material. Some level of review is really a must. If resources are limited, and often they are, use this editing tactic: When in doubt, leave it out.</p>

<p>At present, jQuery is the <em>de facto</em> library for working with the document object model (DOM). It can be used with popular client-side MV* frameworks (such as Backbone), and it has a ton of plugins and a very large community. As developers’ interest in JavaScript increases by the minute, a lot of people are becoming curious about <strong>how native APIs really work</strong> and about when we can just use them instead of including an extra library.</p>
<p>Lately, I have started to see more and more problems with jQuery, at least my use of it. Most of the problems are with jQuery’s core and can’t be fixed without breaking backwards compatibility &mdash; which is very important. I, like many others, continued using the library for a while, navigating all of the pesky quirks every day.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="https://twitter.com/csuwildcat" title="Daniel Buchner">Daniel Buchner</a> created <a href="https://github.com/csuwildcat/SelectorListener" title="SelectorListener">SelectorListener</a>, and <strong>the idea of “live extensions”</strong> manifested. I started to think about creating a set of functions that would enable us to build unobtrusive DOM components using a better approach than what we have used so far. The objective was to review existing APIs and solutions and to build a clearer, testable and lightweight library.</p>
<h3>Adding Useful Features To The Library</h3>
<p>The idea of live extensions encouraged me to develop the <a href="https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom" title="the better-dom project">better-dom project</a>, although other interesting features make the library unique. Let’s review them quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>live extensions</li>
<li>native animations</li>
<li>embedded microtemplating</li>
<li>internationalization support</li>
</ul>
<h4>Live Extensions</h4>
<p>jQuery has a concept called “live events.” Drawing on the idea of event delegation, it enables developers to handle existing and future elements. But more flexibility is required in a lot of cases. For example, delegated events fall short when the DOM needs to be mutated in order to initialize a widget. Hence, live extensions.</p>
<p><strong>The goal is to define an extension once</strong> and have any future elements run through the initialization function, regardless of the widget’s complexity. This is important because it enables us to write Web pages declaratively; so, it works great with AJAX applications.</p>
<p><a href=""><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/new-feature-with-jquery.jpg" width="500" height="293" alt="Live extensions make is easier to handle any future elements." /></a><br/><em>Live extensions enable you to handle any future elements without the need to invoke the initialization function. (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peterhellberg/3777750788/">Image credits</a>)</em></p>
<p>Let’s look at a simple example. Let’s say <strong>our task is to implement a fully customizable tooltip.</strong> The <code>:hover</code> pseudo-selector won’t help us here because the position of the tooltip changes with the mouse cursor. Event delegation doesn’t fit well either; listening to <code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseleave</code> for all elements in the document tree is very expensive. Live extensions to the rescue!</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
DOM.extend("[title]", {
  constructor: function() {
    var tooltip = DOM.create("span.custom-title");

    // set the title's textContent and hide it initially
    tooltip.set("textContent", this.get("title")).hide();

    this
      // remove legacy title
      .set("title", null)
      // store reference for quicker access
      .data("tooltip", tooltip)
      // register event handlers
      .on("mouseenter", this.onMouseEnter, ["clientX", "clientY"])
      .on("mouseleave", this.onMouseLeave)
      // insert the title element into DOM
      .append(tooltip);
  },
  onMouseEnter: function(x, y) {
    this.data("tooltip").style({left: x, top: y}).show();
  },
  onMouseLeave: function() {
    this.data("tooltip").hide();
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p>We can style the <code>.custom-title</code> element in CSS:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">
.custom-title {
  position: fixed; /* required */
  border: 1px solid #faebcc;
  background: #faf8f0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The most interesting part happens when you insert a new element with a <code>title</code> attribute in the page. The custom tooltip will work <strong>without any initialization</strong> call.</p>
<p>Live extensions are self-contained; thus, they don’t require you to invoke an initialization function in order to work with future content. So, they can be combined with any DOM library and will simplify your application logic by separating the UI code into many small independent pieces.</p>
<p>Last but not least, a few words on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/" title="Web Components">Web components</a>. A section of the specification, “<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/#decorator-section" title="Decorators">Decorators</a>,” aims to solve a similar problem. Currently, it uses a markup-based implementation with a special syntax for attaching event listeners to child elements. But it’s still an early draft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Decorators, unlike other parts of Web Components, do not have a specification yet.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Native Animations</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/html5/showcase/transitions/" title="Thanks to Apple">Thanks to Apple</a>, CSS has <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=animation" title="good animation support in CSS">good animation support</a> now. In the past, animations were usually implemented in JavaScript via <code>setInterval</code> and <code>setTimeout</code>. It was a cool feature &mdash; but now it&#8217;s more like a bad practice. Native animations will always be smoother: They are usually faster, take less energy and degrade well if not supported by the browser.</p>
<p>In better-dom, there is no <code>animate</code> method: just <code>show</code>, <code>hide</code> and <code>toggle</code>. To capture a hidden element state in CSS, the library uses the standards-based <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute.</p>
<p>To illustrate how it works, <strong>let’s add a simple animation effect</strong> to the custom tooltip that we introduced earlier:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">
.custom-title {
  position: fixed; /* required */
  border: 1px solid #faebcc;
  background: #faf8f0;
  /* animation code */
  opacity: 1;
  -webkit-transition: opacity 0.5s;
  transition: opacity 0.5s;
}

.custom-title[aria-hidden=true] {
  display: block; /* have to override default "none" */
  opacity: 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Internally, <code>show()</code> and <code>hide()</code> just set the <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute value to be <code>false</code> and <code>true</code>. This is enough to enable the CSS to handle the animations and transitions.</p>
<p>You can see a demo with <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/C3WeM/4/" title="more animation examples using better-dom">more animation examples that use better-dom</a>.</p>
<h4>Embedded Microtemplating</h4>
<p>HTML strings are annoyingly verbose. Looking for a replacement, I found the excellent <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/26/goodbye-zen-coding-hello-emmet/" title="emmet project">Emmet</a>. Today, Emmet is quite a popular plugin for text editors, and it has a nice and compact syntax. Take this HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
body.append("&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class='list-item'&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class='list-item'&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class='list-item'&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;");
</code></pre>
<p>And compare it to the equivalent microtemplate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
body.append("ul>li.list-item*3");
</code></pre>
<p>In better-dom, any method that accepts HTML may use Emmet expressions as well. The <a href="http://jsperf.com/dom-create-vs-jquery/18" title="The abbreviation parser is fast">abbreviation parser is fast</a>, so no need to worry about a performance penalty. A template <a href="https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/wiki/Microtemplating#where-to-use" title="precompilation function">precompilation function</a> also exists to be used on demand.</p>
<h4>Internationalization Support</h4>
<p>Developing a UI widget often requires localization &mdash; not an easy task. Over the years, many have tackled this in different ways. With better-dom, I believe that <strong>changing the state of a CSS selector is like switching languages</strong>.</p>
<p>Conceptually speaking, switching a language is like changing the “representation” of content. In CSS2, several pseudo-selectors help to describe such a model: <code>:lang</code> and <code>:before</code>. Take the code below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">
[data-i18n="hello"]:before {
  content: "Hello Maksim!";
}

[data-i18n="hello"]:lang(ru):before {
  content: "Привет Максим!";
}
</code></pre>
<p>The trick is simple: The value of the <code>content</code> property changes according to the current language, which is determined by the <code>lang</code> attribute of the <code>html</code> element. By using data attributes such as <code>data-i18n</code>, we can maintain the textual content in HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">
[data-i18n]:before {
  content: attr(data-i18n);
}

[data-i18n="Hello Maksim!"]:lang(ru):before {
  content: "Привет Максим!";
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, such CSS isn’t exactly attractive, so better-dom has two helpers: <code>i18n</code> and <code>DOM.importStrings</code>. The first is used to update the <code>data-i18n</code> attribute with the appropriate value, and the second localizes strings for a particular language.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
label.i18n("Hello Maksim!");
// the label displays "Hello Maksim!"
DOM.importStrings("ru",  "Hello Maksim!", "Привет Максим!");
// now if the page is set to ru language,
// the label will display "Привет Максим!"
label.set("lang", "ru");
// now the label will display "Привет Максим!"
// despite the web page's language
</code></pre>
<p>Parameterized strings can be used as well. Just add <code>${param}</code> variables to a key string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
label.i18n("Hello ${user}!", {user: "Maksim"});
// the label will display "Hello Maksim!"
</code></pre>
<h3>Making Native APIs More Elegant</h3>
<p>Generally, we want to stick to standards. But sometimes the standards aren’t exactly user-friendly. <strong>The DOM is a total mess</strong>, and to make it bearable, we have to wrap it in a convenient API. Despite all of the improvements made by open-source libraries, some parts could still be done better:</p>
<ul>
<li>getter and setter,</li>
<li>event handling,</li>
<li>functional methods support.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Getter and Setter</h4>
<p>The native DOM has the <strong>concept of attributes and properties of elements</strong> that could behave differently. Assume we have the markup below on a Web page:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;a href=&quot;/chemerisuk/better-dom&quot; id=&quot;foo&quot; data-test=&quot;test&quot;&gt;better-dom&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To explain why “the DOM is a total mess,” let’s look at this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var link = document.getElementById("foo");

link.href; // => "https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom"
link.getAttribute("href"); // => "/chemerisuk/better-dom"
link["data-test"]; // => undefined
link.getAttribute("data-test"); // => "test"

link.href = "abc";
link.href; // => "https://github.com/abc"
link.getAttribute("href"); // => "abc"
</code></pre>
<p>An attribute value is equal to the appropriate string in HTML, while the element property with the same name could have some special behavior, such as generating the fully qualified URL in the listing above. These differences can be confusing.</p>
<p>In practice, it’s hard to imagine a practical situation in which such a distinction would be useful. Moreover, the developer should always keep in mind which value (attribute or property) is being used that introduces unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>In better-dom, things are clearer. <strong>Every element has only smart getters and setters.</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var link = DOM.find("#foo");

link.get("href"); // => "https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom"
link.set("href", "abc");
link.get("href"); // => "https://github.com/abc"
link.get("data-attr"); // => "test"
</code></pre>
<p>In the first step, it does a property lookup, and if it’s defined, then it’s used for manipulation. Otherwise, getter and setter work with the appropriate attribute of the element. For booleans (checked, selected, etc.), you could just use <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> to update the value: Changing such a property on an element would trigger the appropriate attribute (native behavior) to be updated.</p>
<h4>Improved Event Handling</h4>
<p>Event handling is a big part of the DOM, however, I&#8217;ve discovered one fundamental problem: Having an event object in element listeners forces a developer who cares about testability to mock the first argument, or to create an extra function that passes only event properties used in the handler.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var button = document.getElementById("foo");

button.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
  handleButtonClick(e.button);
}, false);
</code></pre>
<p>This is really annoying. What if we extracted the changing part as an argument? This would allow us to get rid of the extra function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var button = DOM.find("#foo");

button.on("click", handleButtonClick, ["button"]);
</code></pre>
<p>By default, the event handler passes the <code>["target", "defaultPrevented"]</code> array, so no need to add the last argument to get access to these properties:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
button.on("click", function(target, canceled) {
  // handle button click here
});
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Late binding is supported as well</strong> (I’d recommend reading <a href="http://michaux.ca/articles/our-backwards-dom-event-libraries" title="an article on the topic">Peter Michaux’s review of the topic</a>). It’s a more flexible alternative to the regular event handlers that <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-EventListener-handleEvent" title="exists in the W3C standard">exist in the W3C’s standard</a>. It could be useful when you need frequent <code>on</code> and <code>off</code> method calls.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
button._handleButtonClick = function() { alert("click!"); };

button.on("click", "_handleButtonClick");
button.fire("click"); // shows "clicked" message
button._handleButtonClick = null;
button.fire("click"); // shows nothing
</code></pre>
<p>Last but not least, better-dom has none of the shortcuts that exist in legacy APIs and that behave inconsistently across browsers, like <code>click()</code>, <code>focus()</code> and <code>submit()</code>. The only way to call them is to use the <code>fire</code> method, which executes the default action when no listener has returned <code>false</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
link.fire("click"); // clicks on the link
link.on("click", function() { return false; });
link.fire("click"); // triggers the handler above but doesn't do a click
</code></pre>
<h4>Functional Methods Support</h4>
<p>ES5 standardized a couple of useful methods for arrays, including <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code> and <code>some</code>. They allow us to use common collection operations in a standards-based way. As a result, today we have projects like <a href="http://underscorejs.org/" title="underscore">Underscore</a> and <a href="http://lodash.com/" title="lodash">Lo-Dash</a>, which polyfill these methods for old browsers.</p>
<p>Each element (or collection) in better-dom has the methods below built in:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>each</code> (which differs from <code>forEach</code> by returning <code>this</code> instead of <code>undefined</code>)</li>
<li><code>some</code></li>
<li><code>every</code></li>
<li><code>map</code></li>
<li><code>filter</code></li>
<li><code>reduce[Right]</code></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var urls, activeLi, linkText; 

urls = menu.findAll("a").map(function(el) {
  return el.get("href");
});
activeLi = menu.children().filter(function(el) {
  return el.hasClass("active");
});
linkText = menu.children().reduce(function(memo, el) {
  return memo || el.hasClass("active") &#038;&#038; el.find("a").get()
}, false);
</code></pre>
<h3>Avoiding jQuery Problems</h3>
<p>Most of the following issues can’t be fixed in jQuery without breaking backwards compatibility. That’s why creating a new library seemed like the logical way out.</p>
<ul>
<li>the “magical” <code>$</code> function</li>
<li>the value of the <code>[]</code> operator</li>
<li>issues with <code>return false</code></li>
<li><code>find</code> and <code>findAll</code></li>
</ul>
<h4>The “Magical” $ Function</h4>
<p>Everyone has heard at some point that the <code>$</code> (dollar) function is kind of like magic. A single-character name is not very descriptive, so it looks like a built-in language operator. That’s why inexperienced developers call it inline everywhere.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, <strong>the dollar is quite a complex function</strong>. Executing it too often, especially in frequent events such as <code>mousemove</code> and <code>scroll</code>, could cause poor UI performance.</p>
<p>Despite so many articles recommending jQuery objects to be cached, developers continue to insert the dollar function inline, because the library’s syntax encourages them to use this coding style.</p>
<p>Another issue with the dollar function is that it allows us to do two completely different things. People have gotten used to such a syntax, but it’s a bad practice of a function design in general:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
$("a"); // => searches all elements that match “a” selector
$("&lt;a&gt;"); // => creates a &lt;a&gt; element with jQuery wrapper
</code></pre>
<p><strong>In better-dom, several methods cover the responsibilities of the dollar function</strong> in jQuery: <code>find[All]</code> and <code>DOM.create</code>. <code>find[All]</code> is used to search element(s) according to the CSS selector. <code>DOM.create</code> makes a new elements tree in memory. Their names make it very clear what they are responsible for.</p>
<h4>Value of the [] Operator</h4>
<p>Another reason for the problem of frequent dollar function calls is the brackets operator. When a new jQuery object is created, all associated nodes are stored in numeric properties. But note that the value of such a property contains a native element instance (not a jQuery wrapper):</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var links = $("a");

links[0].on("click", function() { ... }); // throws an error
$(links[0]).on("click", function() { ... }); // works fine
</code></pre>
<p>Because of such a feature, every functional method in jQuery or another library (like Underscore) requires the current element to be wrapped with <code>$()</code> inside of a callback function. Therefore, developers must always keep in mind the type of object they are working with &mdash; a native element or a wrapper &mdash; despite the fact that they are using a library to work with the DOM.</p>
<p>In better-dom, the brackets operator returns a library’s object, so developers can forget about native elements. There is only one acceptable way to access them: by using a special <code>legacy</code> method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var foo = DOM.find("#foo");

foo.legacy(function(node) {
  // use Hammer library to bind a swipe listener
  Hammer(node).on("swipe", function(e) {
    // handle swipe gesture here
  }); 
});
</code></pre>
<p>In reality, this method is required in very rare cases, such as to be compatible with a native function or with another DOM library (like <a href="http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/" title="Hammer">Hammer</a> in the example above).</p>
<h4>Issues With return false</h4>
<p>One thing that really blows my mind is the strange <code>return false</code> interception in jQuery’s event handlers. According to the W3C’s standards, it should <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-dt-cancelable-event" title="in most cases">in most cases</a> cancel the default behavior. In jQuery, <code>return false</code> also <a href="http://api.jquery.com/on/#event-handler" title="stops event delegation">stops event delegation</a>.</p>
<p>Such interception creates problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Invoking <code>stopPropagation()</code> by itself could lead to compatibility problems, because it prevents listeners that are related to some other task from doing their work.</li>
<li>Most developers (even experienced ones) are not aware of such behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s unclear why the jQuery community decided to go cross-standards. But better-dom is not going to repeat the same mistake. Thus, <code>return false</code> in an event handler <em>only</em> prevents the browser’s default action, without messing with event propagation, as everyone would expect.</p>
<h4>find and findAll</h4>
<p>Element search is <strong>one of the most expensive operations</strong> in the browser. Two native methods could be used to implement it: <code>querySelector</code> and <code>querySelectorAll</code>. The difference is that the first one stops searching on the first match.</p>
<p>This feature enables us to decrease the iterations count dramatically in certain cases. In my tests, the <a href="http://jsperf.com/dom-find-all-vs-jquery-find/3" title="speed improvement could be up to 20x">speed was up to 20 times faster</a>! Also, you can expect that the improvement will grow according to the size of the document tree.</p>
<p>jQuery has a <code>find</code> method that uses <code>querySelectorAll</code> for general cases. Currently, no function uses <code>querySelector</code> to fetch only the first matched element.</p>
<p>The better-dom library has two separate methods: <code>find</code> and <code>findAll</code>. They allow us to use <code>querySelector</code> optimization. To estimate the potential improvement in performance, I searched for the usage of these methods in all of the source code of my last commercial project:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>find</code><br />
103 matches across 11 files</li>
<li><code>findAll</code><br />
14 matches across 4 files</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>find</code> method is definitely much more popular. It means that <code>querySelector</code> optimization makes sense in most use cases and could give a major performance boost.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Live extensions really make solving front-end problems much easier. Splitting the UI in many small pieces leads to more independent and maintainable solutions. But as we’ve shown, a framework is not only about them (although it is the main goal).</p>
<p>One thing I’ve learned in the development process is that if you don’t like a standard or you have a different opinion of how things should work, then <strong>just implement it and prove that your approach works</strong>. It’s really fun, too!</p>

<p>This article is the second in a series of four articles covering four ways to develop mobile applications. The <a href="http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/22/four-ways-to-build-a-mobile-app-part1-native-ios/">last article</a> covered how to accomplish this using native iOS development tools. In this article, we’ll look at how to build the same sort of application using native Android tools.</p>
<p><strong>We’ve been building a simple tip calculator.</strong> As with the iOS application, this one contains two screens: a main view and a settings view. The settings view persists the default tip percentage to local storage using Android’s SDK support. (The source code for each app is <a href="https://github.com/ptraeg/mobile-apps-4-ways">available on GitHub</a>.)</p>
<p>Here’s the UI we’re following for this project:
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-example-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-example-opt.png" alt="android-example" width="272" height="513" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139877" /></a></p>
<h3>Native Android Development: The Tools</h3>
<p>For the Android platform, the Java language is used, along with the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE). Google provides the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/index.html">Android Developer Tools</a> (ADT) plugin for the standard Eclipse IDE to support things like graphical layout definition and debugging. As of the time of writing, Google has also released a new IDE, called <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">Android Studio</a>, in early-access preview. This product is based on JetBrains’ IntelliJ IDE and will eventually replace Eclipse as the official development tool for Android applications. Because Android Studio is still in prerelease form, <strong>we’ll use Eclipse to develop this application</strong>. Eclipse is very stable, and many Android training resources using Eclipse abound.</p>
<p>The Android development environment is supported on Windows, Mac and Linux. There is no charge for the development tools, and applications may be freely deployed to devices. To submit apps to the Google Play marketplace, developers must <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/">sign up</a> for publishing and pay a one-time fee of $25. Submitting apps to Google Play is notably less involved than for iOS. When your application is submitted to Google, it is scanned for malware and common threats. Generally, the application becomes available to the general public within a few hours.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/index.html">overview</a> of the toolset can be found on the Android Developers website. Successful Android development entails use of the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eclipse IDE</li>
<li>Android SDK</li>
<li>Android ADT</li>
<li>Android system images for the Android emulator</li>
<li>an Android device (technically not required but highly recommended)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Grab an Installation Bundle to Ease Your Pain</h4>
<p>In the past, you had to download, install and configure the tools individually. This took a fair amount of time and often led to confusion for new Android developers. To make the process easier, Google now offers “bundles,” which simplify the installation process. Bundles are offered for each operating system and are available on the page where you <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">download the developer SDK</a>.</p>
<p>Installing Eclipse, the SDK, the emulator and so on <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html" >is as easy as unpacking</a> a ZIP file into a directory. If you have an existing installation of Eclipse and would prefer to use that instead, there are <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html" >instructions for adding Android support</a> to it.</p>
<h3>Loading An Existing Application Into Eclipse</h3>
<p>Once the Android development tools have been installed, you may wish to import an existing project, such as the <a href="https://github.com/ptraeg/mobile-apps-4-ways">source code</a> for our sample app. In Eclipse, go to <code>File &rarr; Import</code> in the menu, which will display the following dialog:</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-import-step1-500-opt.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-import-step1-500-opt.jpg" alt="android-import-step1" width="554" height="551" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-140375" /></a></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen the option to import an existing Android project, click the “Next” button, whereupon you will be able to specify the directory where the code that you wish to work with in Eclipse is located.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-import-step2-500-opt.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-import-step2-500-opt.jpg" alt="android-import-step2" width="559" height="552" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-140376" /></a></p>
<p>Once you’ve selected a directory via the “Browse” button, Eclipse will automatically find any Android project in that directory and show it in the list of projects to import. Simply click the “Finish” button, and the project will appear in your list of projects along the left side of the IDE.</p>
<h3>Steps To Building An Application</h3>
<p>There are several steps to building an Android application. We’ll cover each in detail later in this article. The steps include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define the user interface. The UI for an application is generally defined as a series of layout files. These are XML-based files that describe the controls on a screen and the relationship of their layouts relative to one another.</li>
<li>Add image assets, language translations and other resources. <strong>Android refers to non-code assets of a project as resources.</strong> These are placed in the project in a directory structure defined by the Android SDK. At runtime, Android dynamically loads content from this directory structure. We’ll see later on how different assets and layouts can be loaded to support the wide variety of Android device configurations available in the market today.</li>
<li>Write Java code to respond to various events that occur from the controls on a given screen and from changes in the lifecycle of an application. Java code is also responsible for loading the layout and menu files associated with each screen. And it’s used to control the flow from one screen to the next.</li>
<li>Export the completed Android application as a file that can be uploaded to Google Play or shared with others directly.</li>

<h3>The Eclipse ADT For Android Development</h3>
<p>The Eclipse IDE provides the standard source-code editing tools, along with a source-level debugger that allows applications to be debugged on both the simulator and a physical device. In contrast to the storyboards used with iOS, a layout editor is used to define screen layouts:</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/adt-layout-editor.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/adt-layout-editor-500-opt.jpg" alt="ADT layout editor" width="500" height="299" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139867" /></a><br />
<em>(<a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/adt-layout-editor.png">Large view</a>)</em></p>
<p>The layout editor works on a single screen at a time and is not able to define segues between screens, as in the iOS storyboard editor. However, the Android layout editor does have a very flexible layout system that supports the wide range of screen sizes and resolutions of Android devices.</p>
<p>Unlike the storyboard editor in iOS, you can edit the layouts in either visual mode, as shown above, or an XML-based editor. Simply use the tabs at the bottom of the layout editor to switch between the two views. As the layouts become more complex, being able to edit the layout files directly comes in handy. A snippet of layout XML looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
                xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="match_parent"
                tools:context=".MainActivity" &gt;

    &lt;EditText
            android:id="@+id/billAmtEditText"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_alignParentTop="true"
            android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
            android:layout_marginTop="20dp"
            android:ems="10"
            android:gravity="right|center_vertical"
            android:hint="@string/billAmount"
            android:inputType="number|numberSigned|numberDecimal" &gt;
        &lt;requestFocus /&gt;
    &lt;/EditText&gt;

    &lt;Button
            android:id="@+id/calcTipButton"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_below="@+id/billAmtEditText"
            android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
            android:layout_marginTop="19dp"
            android:text="@string/calculateTip" /&gt;

    &lt;TextView
            android:id="@+id/TextView01"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_alignLeft="@+id/billAmtEditText"
            android:layout_below="@id/calcTipButton"
            android:layout_marginTop="18dp"
            android:text="@string/tipPercentage"
            android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceMedium"/&gt;
&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>Android Resources: Support For Various Device Capabilities</h3>
<p>The Android SDK was designed from the outset to support a wide variety of device capabilities. Much has been written about the “fragmentation” of devices on the Android platform. However, from the beginning, the Android SDK was designed to support this variety of device attributes, including screen size, pixel density and Android API versions.</p>
<p>Screen layouts, image assets (called drawables), styles and other configuration files are all incorporated in a series of subdirectories underneath a master “resource” directory. The <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html#AlternativeResources">Android SDK documentation</a> illustrates how multiple versions of the same file can be placed in uniquely named directories within this resource structure, so that the proper one is loaded depending on the capabilities and orientation of the device at runtime.</p>
<p>Consider this directory structure:</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-file-structure-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-file-structure-opt.png" alt="android-file-structure" width="283" height="546" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139878" /></a></p>
<p>The structure above shows <strong>uniquely named directories for drawable assets</strong>, with suffixes of <code>-hdpi</code>, <code>-ldpi</code>, <code>-mdpi</code> and so on. This permits the developer to supply different image content to correspond with the DPI resolution of a given screen. Similar capabilities extend to things like the layout files, which may supply unique content according to screen size, landscape or portrait orientation, etc. In the example above, we see unique folders for <code>values-v11</code> and <code>values-v14</code>. This allows for two different <code>styles.xml</code> files to be used for version 11 (Android 3.x) and version 14 (Android 4.x) of the Android operating system.</p>
<p>Note, also, the regular <code>values</code> directory. Android versions prior to version 11 would obtain their <code>styles.xml</code> from this directory. This fallback mechanism is in place for all resources. The SDK will attempt to find the resource in the particular directory and then fall back to a more “generic” resource if it’s not available. All of this occurs without the developer having to write any special code. Simply drop the resources into the proper directories, and the Android runtime will take care of the rest. Each of your resources <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/accessing-resources.html">may be accessed</a> from both the XML and Java files in your application.</p>
<p>The resource system is quite powerful and supports <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/available-resources.html">many types of resources</a>. In addition to the drawable, layout, menu and styles for your application, it can also be used to hold <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/more-resources.html">application constants</a> for arrays or dimensional values in your application. In this manner, you can load different constant values for various device configurations simply by placing the files in the proper directory structure. You can also use this system to support <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization.html">localization</a>. This is accomplished through the <code>strings.xml</code> file. Here’s an example of the <code>strings.xml</code> file associated with our application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;string name="app_name"&gt;FasTip&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="hello_world"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="menu_settings"&gt;Settings&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="billAmount"&gt;Bill Amount&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="calculateTip"&gt;Calculate Tip&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="tipAmount"&gt;Tip Amount&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="totalAmount"&gt;Total Amount&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="title_activity_settings"&gt;Settings&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="saveSettings"&gt;Save Settings&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="tipPercentage"&gt;Tip Percentage&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="percentSymbol"&gt;%&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The base string file is placed in the <code>res/values</code> directory of the application. If you wanted to offer a Spanish version of the same file, you would place it in the <code>res/values-es</code> directory.</p>
<h4>Resource IDs</h4>
<p>In the process of defining the layouts, you should <strong>associate an ID value with each control</strong> (or UI widget) that you wish to reference from code. This can be done by specifying an ID value in the properties inspector in the layout editor:</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/android-eclipse-id-property.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-eclipse-id-property-500-opt.jpg" alt="android-eclipse-id-property-500" width="500" height="352" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139872" /></a><br />
<em>(<a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/android-eclipse-id-property.png">Large view</a>)</em></p>
<h3>Layout Managers</h3>
<p>Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout.html">layout</a> files may use a number of layout managers, or ViewGroups, to arrange the controls on the screen. This is Android’s approach to laying out views, much like the constraints system we saw in iOS. <strong>Here are some of the more common ViewGroups used in Android apps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/linear.html">LinearLayout</a><br />
This is used to lay out a series of controls in either horizontal or vertical orientation.</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/relative.html">RelativeLayout</a><br />
This is used to position controls relative to one another or to the bounds of their parents’ layout. This is a flexible layout system and is often used as an alternative to nesting linear layouts.</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/listview.html">ListView</a><br />
This is a view group that presents a series of vertically scrolling items, much like a <code>UITableView</code> for those familiar with iOS. In Android, you write a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListAdapter.html">ListAdapter</a> to provide a view for each row of data in a data source.</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/gridview.html">GridView</a><br />
This is similar to a list view, but it provides items in a two-dimensional, scrollable grid. Just like the list view, it also uses an adapter to provide view contents for each cell in the grid.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our sample application, two layout files have been created: <code>activity_main.xml</code> for the main screen and <code>activity_settings.xml</code> for the settings screen. So far, we’ve just defined the appearance of things. Unlike the iOS storyboard editor, Android has no “assistant” tool to directly link the controls in the visual layout editor to the code. We’ll need to write some code to connect these components together and build the application.</p>
<h3>Android: Activities And Intents</h3>
<p>In iOS, we loaded the logic specific to a given screen into a <code>ViewController</code>. In Android, these separate screens are treated as separate “activities.” Just like in an iOS <code>UIViewController</code>, there is a defined life cycle for an activity that governs when the activity starts, pauses, resumes and stops.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/activity-lifecycle-500-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/activity-lifecycle-500-opt.png" alt="activity-lifecycle" width="513" height="663" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139866" /></a></p>
<p>The diagram above comes straight from the Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities.html#Lifecycle">Developers documentation</a> and shows the lifecycle of an activity. It’s up to the developer to place code in the various methods of the activity to respond to the various states of the lifecycle.</p>
<pre><code class="language-clike">
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {

    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    tipPctTextView = (TextView)this.findViewById(R.id.tipPctTextView);
    tipAmountTextView = (TextView)this.findViewById(R.id.tipAmtTextView);
    totalAmountTextView = (TextView)this.findViewById(R.id.totalAmtTextView);
    calcTipAmountButton = (Button)this.findViewById(R.id.calcTipButton);
    billAmountTextView = (EditText)this.findViewById(R.id.billAmtEditText);

    calcTipAmountButton.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            calculateTip();
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p>The code above is executed early on in the activity’s lifecycle. In this case, we are loading the layout file that was defined earlier, via this statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-clike">
setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
</code></pre>
<p>Upon successfully loading the layout, we obtain references to the various controls that make up the layout. Notice that we are referencing the layouts and the IDs via the <code>R.</code> notation. <strong>These are the resource IDs that we defined earlier in the layout manager.</strong> Additionally, we attach a click listener to define what code should run when the user taps on the “Calculate Tip” button.</p>
<p>In the iOS example, we used <code>NSUserDefaults</code> to save and restore the user’s preference for a tip percentage. In Android, the equivalent is <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#pref">sharedPreferences</a>. This can be seen in the code snippet below, where we restore the persisted value for <code>tipPercentage</code> in the local variable <code>tipPctString</code>. Notice that the first time the user runs this app, a default value of <code>15.0</code> is used.</p>
<pre><code class="language-clike">
private void loadTipPercentage() {
    SharedPreferences preferences =
                this.getSharedPreferences("AppPreferences", MODE_PRIVATE);
    String tipPctString = preferences.getString("tipPercentage", "15.0");
    tipPctTextView.setText(String.format("%s%%", tipPctString));
    tipPercentage = Double.parseDouble(tipPctString) / 100;
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Defining a Menu for Our Activity</h4>
<p>Android applications do not use the <code>NavigationController</code> approach of iOS applications. In Android 4.x devices, the choices that appear in the upper-right of the screen are part of the Android “<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/actionbar.html">action bar</a>.”</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-action-bar-500-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-action-bar-500-opt.png" alt="android-action-bar" width="480" height="270" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-140378" /></a><br />
<em>The action bar is the dark header in this screenshot. Note the settings button in the upper-right, which is defined by the menu.</em></p>
<p>We populate the action bar by defining a series of <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/menus.html">menu options</a> in an XML file, just as we did with the screen layout. The menu is placed in a menu directory within the resources directory. Here are the contents of the menu file used on the main screen of our application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" &gt;
    &lt;item
        android:id="@+id/menu_settings"
        android:orderInCategory="100"
        android:showAsAction="ifRoom"
        android:title="@string/menu_settings"
        android:icon="@android:drawable/ic_menu_preferences"/&gt;
&lt;/menu&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that, in this case, we have just one menu option to access the settings screen. If more options were placed in the menu than could fit on the screen, then the remaining items would flow into a drop-down menu, accessible via the three vertical dots often seen in Android menus. To use the menu in our activity, we must load it at the correct time. This is done in the <code>onCreateOptionsMenu</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-clike">
@Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
    // Inflate the menu; this adds items to the action bar if it is present.
    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.activity_main, menu);
    return true;
}

// Respond to menu selections
@Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
    // Handle item selection
    switch (item.getItemId()) {
        case R.id.menu_settings:
            this.startSettings();
            return true;
        default:
            return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how the <code>onOptionsItemSelected</code> method is used to determine what code is run when a given menu option is chosen.</p>
<h3>Starting Another Activity</h3>
<p>As we’ve seen from the code above, when the user chooses the settings icon from the action bar, the <code>startSettings()</code> method is invoked. This is the code that launches the second activity to display the settings screen:</p>
<pre><code class="language-clike">
private void startSettings() {
    Intent settingsIntent = new Intent();
    settingsIntent.setClass(this, SettingsActivity.class);
    startActivity(settingsIntent);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Android launches activities via an <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html">intent</a> object. In this simple example, we are creating a very specific intent to launch the <code>SettingsActivity</code> class, which contains the code to load and drive the settings screen. Most Android applications use this technique to move the user from one screen to the next in an application.</p>
<h4>Using Intents for App Integration</h4>
<p>Intents are considerably more flexible than this. It’s possible to use intents to launch a variety of activities. A common intent is to send an item to be shared via social networking apps. If you’ve used an Android device before, then you’ll know that doing something like this typically brings up a menu of applications that support a sharing intent. This list often contains applications such as Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/android-share-list.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-share-list-338-opt.jpg" alt="android-share-list-338" width="338" height="601" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140381" /></a></p>
<p>This particular sharing intent is known as <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_SEND">ACTION_SEND</a>. All of the applications that support sharing are listening for a common intent. <strong>When an Android application is installed on a device, its manifest file describes the intents it can process.</strong> In this way, several applications may be installed, each of which supports the same intent.</p>
<p>If only one application supports the intent, then that activity is immediately launched. Whereas if multiple applications are installed for the same intent, then Android would show a menu of options, from which the user would make a selection before the intent is sent to the chosen activity.</p>
<p>The intent system in Android is a unique feature that can be used to create workflows across several applications. When building for the Android platform, you should keep this capability in mind because it offers a way to integrate your application with others.</p>
<h3>The Settings Screen</h3>
<p>Much of what occurs here has already been covered in the section on the main activity. This activity has similar code in the <code>onCreate</code> method to load the appropriate layout file and obtain references to the controls. When the “Save Settings” button is pressed, the following code is run to save the tip percentage value to storage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-clike">
private void saveSettings() {
    if (validateSettings()) {
        SharedPreferences preferences =
            this.getSharedPreferences("AppPreferences", MODE_PRIVATE);
        SharedPreferences.Editor prefEditor = preferences.edit();
        prefEditor.putString("tipPercentage",
            tipPercentageEditText.getText().toString());
        prefEditor.commit();
        this.finish();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the last line in the <code>saveSettings</code> method calls the <code>finish()</code> method. This causes the current activity to stop running and returns the user to the prior activity, which in our case is the main screen. Contrast this with iOS’ use of the <code>NavigationController</code> and the way we popped the current view controller off the stack of view controllers.</p>
<h3>Running Your Application</h3>
<p>Android provides two basic ways to test an application: in the Android emulator or on a regular device such as a phone or tablet. Unlike with iOS, you don’t have to pay any fees to deploy your app to your own device or to share it with other Android users. The only fee that is required is if you wish to <a href="http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/publish/register.html">feature your app in Google Play</a>.</p>
<p>The emulator enables you to emulate a variety of Android versions, as well as different screen aspect ratios and resolutions. While testing your application on a real device is always a good idea, the emulator helps you to test on device configurations that are not readily available.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-emulator-opt.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-emulator-opt.jpg" alt="android-emulator" width="389" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139876" /></a></p>
<p><strong>To use the emulator, you must create an Android Virtual Device (AVD).</strong> Think of this as a virtual phone or tablet. Creating multiple AVDs, each with a unique configuration, is possible to test your app on different screen sizes and memory capacities. Android Developers provides details on how to <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/managing-avds.html">use the AVD manager</a> to set up these devices.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-avd-manager-500-opt.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-avd-manager-500-opt.jpg" alt="android-avd-manager" width="438" height="291" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139869" /></a></p>
<h4>Use Hardware Virtualization to Speed Up That Slow Emulator</h4>
<p>The Android emulator has long been maligned for its poor performance on many machines. This is because, in the past, the emulator has been running actual code compiled for the ARM processor on a phone, rather than for the x86 CPU that’s likely on your development machine.</p>
<p>Recently, an x86 <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html#accel-vm">hardware-virtualized</a> version has been made available. This version starts up and runs considerably faster than the traditional emulator. The hardware-virtualized version will generally run on a Windows or Mac OS X machine with an Intel Core i3 or later processor that supports hardware virtualization. AMD processors are currently supported only on Linux.</p>
<p>Creating an AVD that uses hardware virtualization requires that you set up Intel’s HAXM support first. The developer documentation provides <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html#accel-vm">details on the process</a> to follow for your operating system. Make sure that you are running the <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager/">latest HAXM support</a>; if you’re on Mac OS X Mavericks, a recently released hotfix resolves issues there as well.</p>
<h4>Testing on a Device</h4>
<p>To test the application on your own device, you’ll need to enable USB debugging on the device. Google provides detailed instructions on <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#setting-up">setting up your device</a> for debugging.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-usb-debug-opt.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-usb-debug-opt.jpg" alt="android-usb-debug" width="304" height="541" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139883" /></a></p>
<p>For Android 4.0 devices, go to <code>Settings &rarr; Developer Options</code> in the menu and you’ll see a checkbox to enable this. If you’re on Windows, you might need to install some USB drivers for your device; these can usually be downloaded from the manufacturer’s website. For Mac OS X, you usually will not need any drivers and can just plug in the device via a USB cable.</p>
<p>The Eclipse IDE provides a “targets” option that enables you to specify which device, or AVD, should be used to run your application. This can be found in <code>Run &rarr; Run Configurations</code> and <code>Run &rarr; Debug Configurations</code> in the menu. The “Targets” tab allows you to select which AVD should be used by default or to set a prompt each time to select a run or debug destination for the application:</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/android-run-target.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-run-target-500-opt.jpg" alt="android-run-target-500" width="500" height="397" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139881" /></a></p>
<p>If you select “Always prompt to pick device,” then the IDE will present this dialog each time you choose to run or debug the application:</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/android-device-chooser.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/android-device-chooser-500-opt.jpg" alt="android-device-chooser-500" width="500" height="361" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139870" /></a></p>
<p>Every time you run or debug the application, an APK file is built and written to the <code>/bin</code> directory of your project’s root directory. This is the application distribution package used for Android devices. It’s analogous to the IPA file for iOS applications. When you select a deployment target via the process above, the Android development tools will automatically install the APK on the target device or emulator and run it.</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Application With Others</h3>
<p>Submitting an application to Google Play is beyond the scope of this article. The documentation provides an <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/publishing_overview.html">overview</a> of the process. You can also use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html#ExportWizard">export wizard</a> in Eclipse to export an APK file. The resulting APK file can then be shared with others outside of Google Play via <a href="http://developer.android.com/distribute/open.html">open distribution</a>, and it is very useful when sharing copies of your application for testing prior to general release.</p>
<h3>Android: Learning Resources</h3>
<p>As with iOS, some excellent resources exist for getting started with Android. I recommend the following books and websites:</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>That wraps up our coverage of developing a native app for Android. We’ve seen some unique capabilities of the platform, such as the resource system, layouts, and the way that activities and intents work together. In the next article, we’ll take the tip calculator cross-platform, looking at what’s involved in developing our app for both iOS and Android using PhoneGap.</p>

<p>Just over four years ago, I decided to take a part-time position teaching website design and front-end development at a local university, <a href="http://ww2.uri.edu/">the University of Rhode Island</a>. My time in the classroom has been one of the most challenging as well as one of the most rewarding experiences in my career, and I believe that other Web professionals would greatly benefit from spending some time in an educational setting teaching others their craft.</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at some of the challenges to prepare for if you are considering taking on a teaching position. I will also present some of my personal experiences and insights, including the benefits and rewards I’ve enjoyed as a teacher, to help you consider such a move for your own career.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by looking at some of those aforementioned challenges as well as the solutions I&#8217;ve used to meet them over the years.</p>
<h4>Not Everyone Learns The Same Way</h4>
<p>Where you teach, as well as the variety of students in your classroom, will have a dramatic impact on your overall experience. Over the years, students from all walks of life, age groups and experience levels have taken my course. The only constant is that <strong>every one of them is completely different</strong> — which poses quite a challenge when preparing materials and exercises for the class.</p>
<p>Ultimately, your job is to do what you feel would help the students understand the concepts best. Yet, no matter how well you prepare, the reality is that your materials will work great for some students and not so well for others. You will not be able to reach all students equally because everyone learns differently.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/opensourceway/4929153543/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ladders-opt.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="" title="" /></a><br /><em>Everyone learns differently, and your responsibility as the teacher is to respond to those different needs. (Image credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/opensourceway/4929153543/">opensourceway</a>)</em></p>
<p>As you receive feedback from students and realize which ones get it and which ones are lost, you will need to adjust your lesson plans to make sure that you reach all students, not just best and brightest who understood the concepts right away. Of course, part of the challenge is that <strong>you must strike a balance</strong> here. You’ve spent time carefully considering and building your lesson plans, and you don’t want to blow it up and redo everything because a particular student did not respond well to them. Instead, find ways to get those slower-paced learners up to speed.</p>
<p>I had one student a few years ago who found it difficult to keep up. He was always falling behind, and he felt bad about asking too many questions and holding up the rest of the class — but by asking fewer questions, he fell further behind, and the problem just worsened. Eventually, I suggested that he bring in a digital camera to record the lessons so that he could go over them again later at his own pace. I wasn’t thrilled about the idea of being recorded, but I felt it would help him, so I was open to the idea.</p>
<p>The change was immediate. Watching the recordings at home and going through the lab exercises for a second time at his <em>own</em> pace, he found that the lessons began to make sense and that he was able to keep up in class. His final project ended up being one of the best of the group — a dramatic turnaround from where he started in the course.</p>
<h4>Not Everyone Is Cut Out To Be A Web Designer</h4>
<p>That being said, the reality is that some students, no matter how much extra attention you give them or how responsive you are to their learning needs, will just never get the material. Unfortunately, I’ve had to drop a number of students from my class over the years. Despite my best efforts, including extra materials developed specifically for these students and extra class time to answer their questions and tutor them, <strong>they simply didn’t understand the concepts being taught</strong>.</p>
<p>In most cases, these students tried incredibly hard. They put in the effort required, but the results weren’t there and the rest of the class was held up because of their struggle. Having to sit down with those students and explain that I didn’t think they were right for the class is easily the most uncomfortable thing I have had to do as a teacher.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pinksherbet/6961676525/"><img title="" alt="" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/student-sleeping-opt.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a><br/><em>Failing to get through to a student does not necessarily mean that your material or teaching approach is bad. In many cases, it’s not you, it’s the student. (Image credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pinksherbet/6961676525/">D Sharon Pruitt</a>)</em></p>
<p>If you are going to take on a teaching role, be prepared to make difficult decisions. As uncomfortable as these conversations are, they are sometimes necessary for the good of the class.</p>
<h4>Rewriting Lesson Plans</h4>
<p>The Web is constantly changing. Lesson plans and exercises that were relevant one semester may be woefully outdated the next. As the Web evolves, so too must your lesson plans.</p>
<p>When I began teaching over four years ago, responsive design hadn’t yet become the best practice it is today. Now, it is one of the most important aspects of my course. Despite all of the work I had put into the class materials, I had to pretty much start from scratch when I decided to introduce responsive Web design into the lessons.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure to teach skills that are relevant to the industry today</strong>, revisiting your lessons after each semester and making changes as needed. Most of the time, I need to make only minor changes to course materials; I rarely have to start from scratch. Either way, though, prepare to revise your lesson plans regularly if you hope to keep the course relevant and up to date. Furthermore, understand that your time in the classroom is just a fraction of the time you will have to spend preparing for the class.</p>
<h4>The Constraints Of Time</h4>
<p>Speaking of time, another challenge is that you have only so much time with the students. So, you need to pick and choose exactly what to present according to what you feel will serve them best. If your classes are like mine and many of your students have no previous experience with Web design, HTML or CSS, then you’ll need to start with the basics. <strong>Giving students an understanding of basic design principles</strong> and introducing HTML and CSS all the way up to the most current best practices is a tall order. In the end, you have to leave some things out and accept that you <em>can’t</em> teach students <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>Take support for Internet Explorer (IE) 6. Finding ways to support that old browser has consumed countless hours for those of us who have been in the industry for years, but we don’t struggle with it much these days because use of IE 6 is now so low. Among most of the websites I have worked on lately, IE 6 does not even factor in the user base. Because of this, I have decided not to discuss the challenges of IE 6 because I do not feel it is relevant to the work the students will do once they leave the classroom. If we covered IE 6 support, it would mean we have that much less time to cover something else. The challenge is to <strong>decide what is more (and most) important</strong> and to make the best use of the time available to present those concepts.</p>
<p>As a side note, websites like Smashing Magazine and other online sources that have built an archive of articles about Web design topics over the years are an invaluable resource for those of us who are teaching the next generation of designers and developers. So much of what we do today is built on the practices of the past. <strong>The history of our industry is important</strong>, but finding time to present all of that history in the classroom is hard. So, referring students to topics and articles to read is an important strategy for teachers. This is why these archives of articles, which might not seem relevant to today’s best practices, are so important and why decisions like .NET Magazine’s to <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/net/creative-bloq-welcomes-readers-net-magazine-9134344">drop thousands of old articles</a> when it resigned its website is <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/09/19/good-content-is-too-valuable-to-die/">such a problem</a>.</p>
<p>As Andy Clarke states in his article “<a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/preserving-the-history-of-web-design">Preserving the History of Web Design</a>,” we need to ensure that new professionals in our industry learn this history, “to learn about the progress we made so they don’t undo it.” Unfortunately, we cannot cover all of that history in the classroom, so the challenge is to figure out how much of it to present and how much to refer them to for review outside of the classroom.</p>
<h4>You Represent The Industry</h4>
<p>You will be the first Web professional who most of your students have ever met or been able to speak with at length. <strong>To them, you represent the industry</strong>. The stories you tell and the opinions you share will shape their own understanding and opinions of the industry. That is a pretty big responsibility.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dellphotos/6269913300/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/whiteboard-opt.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="" title="" /></a><br/><em>Always keep in mind that you play a major role in shaping your students&#8217; understanding and opinions of the Web industry. (Image credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dellphotos/6269913300/">Dell Inc.</a>)</em></p>
<p>We all have bad days, but taking negativity from the office into the classroom will absolutely affect how your students see the industry. You don’t have to present the job as being all rainbows and gumdrops, but be mindful of what you say to students and avoid using the classroom as a place to blow off steam, regardless of how bad your day is or how frustrating an exchange with a client has been. <strong>Complaining about clients is never productive or appropriate</strong>, and too many in our industry relish the opportunity to share bad stories. Doing this with students gives them the wrong impression and trains them not to respect clients.</p>
<p>You have an opportunity to set these new Web professionals off on the right path. By maintaining a positive outlook and by exposing the students to the best parts of our industry, you can help to cultivate designers and developers who will help our industry continue to grow, instead of hold it back.</p>
<h4>You Are Responsible For What You Put Into This World</h4>
<p>Building on this theme of responsibility, you are absolutely responsible for what you put into the world. I have heard many Web designers echo this sentiment as they look to do work that has meaning and that makes a difference. The projects and clients we take on and the websites we launch into the world are our responsibility — and that responsibility is multiplied many times over when you decide to become a teacher.</p>
<p>As a teacher, you are at least partially responsible for the work your students will do. When your students go on to do great things, it is awesome. One of my students a few years ago took a position with an important non-profit organization in our area. Seeing her work make a difference for that organization and the people it helps was extremely gratifying.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all interactions with former students end as positively as this one did. Other former students of mine have done really bad work as freelancers. I remember one former student contacting me and asking me to look at the most recent website he had designed and developed for a client. There is no way to sugarcoat it — the website was bad. The design was unattractive, the user experience confusing, and the code sloppy and poorly written. This put me in an uncomfortable position.</p>
<p>He was obviously very excited about his work and was asking for feedback, but any feedback I could give would be negative. In the end, I told him that I was happy to see him working on the skills we had covered in class, and I suggested a few improvements to the website. The student thanked me for my input and made a few changes to the website. Since that time, I have followed his work and seen other mediocre websites that he has designed for clients, but he never again asked for my feedback, nor have I offered it.</p>
<p><strong>This experience was not confined to this one student</strong>. Over the years, other former students have taken on freelance work and subsequently launched poor websites into the world. I would be lying if I told you I didn’t feel some responsibility for these poorly done websites, but in the end, you cannot police every student once they leave the class. All you can do is give them the best information and show them the right way to design and develop a website. What they do with that information, for better or for worse, is something you have no real control over.</p>
<h3>Rewards And Benefits</h3>
<p>So far, we’ve looked only at the challenges of teaching in this industry. Those challenges are real and substantial, but if you can meet them, then you’ll also find a number of rewards and benefits from taking on this responsibility. Let’s now turn to some of those rewards.</p>
<h4>Helping Others</h4>
<p>Helping others can be a powerful experience. Spending time in the classroom to teach others your craft is one way to use the knowledge you have gained to improve the lives of others.</p>
<p>Many of the students I teach are unemployed or underemployed. Their tuition for my class is paid for by a grant set up to give them skills relevant to today’s workforce. Helping these unemployed individuals to better themselves and learn new skills is important work, and <strong>seeing students go on to find good entry-level jobs in the industry is incredibly rewarding</strong>. Hearing from those students later on that the lessons and conversations in the class helped to prepare them for success really makes all of my hard work worthwhile.</p>
<p>I have always loved the giving, collaborative nature of the Web industry. Teaching students is one way to contribute to the Web community while having a real impact on the lives of others.</p>
<h4>Learning By Teaching</h4>
<p>One of the best ways to truly understand something is by teaching it to others. While my time in the classroom is dedicated to teaching website design, I would be lying if I said that I didn’t learn quite a bit from the experience as well.</p>
<p>Try to explain the CSS box model or the difference between relative and absolute positioning to a new student, and I guarantee you will understand the concept better than before. This greater understanding and the experience of explaining these technical concepts to students will also help you speak with clients.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/opensourceway/5538035618/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/teacher-learner-opt.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="Teacher/Learner" title="Teacher/Learner" /></a><br /><em>Teaching forces you to find ways to explain concepts in a way that others who do not have the benefit of your experience will grasp. (Image credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/opensourceway/5538035618/">opensourceway</a>)</em></p>
<p>Being able to communicate with clients without being too technical or intimidating, and in a way that helps them to grasp the concepts enough to be able to make informed decisions about their business and their website, is an important skill. <strong>The lessons you prepare and your conversations with students</strong> can and will equip you for these client interactions and make you better at what you do.</p>
<h4>Generating Business</h4>
<p>Speaking of clients, I wouldn’t have expected this when I began teaching, but my time in the classroom has led to a number of projects outside of the classroom. Multiple students have passed along solid leads to me because they could not handle the projects themselves with their level of experience. Former students have also invited the agency I work for to bid on projects initiated by the organizations they’ve joined.</p>
<p>Over the years, a number of people have asked me whether I realize that, by being a teacher, I am training professionals who will one day replace me or, at the very least, take work away from me. I’ve honestly never felt that way. I’ve always felt that there is more than enough work to go around. And, as my experience shows, <strong>being a teacher and making a positive impression on your students</strong> will not only <em>not</em> lose you clients, but could actually generate business for you and your agency.</p>
<h3>How Do I Get Started?</h3>
<p>Hopefully, this article has given you some points to think about as you consider whether a teaching position is right for you at this point in your career. If you’d like to explore this possibility, how should you begin?</p>
<p>My opportunity came when I began telling others of my desire to speak more about our industry and the work that I do. A fellow Web developer who had taught at the university for many years heard me one day and, knowing of an opening at the school, referred me. Within a few weeks, I was in front of my first group of students.</p>
<p>While my experience might not be typical, there is a lesson in it. Spreading the word about your interest in a teaching position could open doors. <strong>Do not be shy to let others know</strong> that you’d like to explore this move.</p>
<p>Other strategies are to contact your local universities, colleges, and business centers to see whether they have any openings. Sometimes, a little outreach turns up an amazing opportunity.</p>
<p>If you can’t find an opening at an institution of higher education or you feel you are not yet ready for that level and would like to start smaller, consider giving small workshops or classes at a local library or even as a private tutor.</p>
<p>Whatever path you choose to get started, consider what you can offer to students who are interested in learning more about our industry. I assure you that the students will not be the only ones who get something positive from the experience.</p>

<p>My colleague Ajay and I have been working at incorporating lean UX at the enterprise level for over two years. In studying it, I find that <strong>there’s a temptation to lay down rules</strong>, and if the rules aren’t followed&#8230; well, then, you can’t call it lean UX. At the end of the day, though, some lean UX is better than none.</p>
<p>If you were told to finish off the following sentence, how would you do it?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You’re not practicing lean UX if&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked that very same question on Twitter, LinkedIn and email to some <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/07/lean-ux-getting-out-of-the-deliverables-business/">lean UX thinkers</a> out there. My personal conclusion is simple. Lean UX is a set of principles that may be used to guide you to better, more desirable solutions for users. It’s not a process in which each tool is rigidly applied.</p>
<p>Let me give you a real-world example. Co-location is a hot topic in the lean UX discussion. If you talk to experts and read their tweets and blogs, you might get the sense that if you’re not a co-located, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5965280/follow-jeff-bezos-two-pizza-rule-to-avoid-the-dangers-of-groupthink">two-pizza-eating team</a>, then you can’t practice lean UX. I know that this is not the intent of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lean-UX-Applying-Principles-Experience/dp/1449311652">authors of resources on lean UX</a>, but it’s out there. Frankly, the situation is ideal, but if you work in a large company, it might not be the reality.</p>
<p><strong>The value of co-location is obvious.</strong> As Jeff Gothelf describes in his book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021827.do"><em>Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is more effective than walking over to a colleague, showing some work, discussing, sketching, exchanging ideas, understanding facial expressions and body language, and reaching a resolution on a thorny topic.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t agree more, but in one of my projects, it’s not a reality. Our team is spread across three states, two countries and three companies. We believe, however, that we can still practice the fundamentals of lean UX successfully despite this, and I believe we do. Our methods might make a purist cringe, but we have a measure of success (and also measurable success).</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ux-discussion.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ux-discussion.jpg" alt="ux-discussion" width="500" height="310" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-120359" /></a><br />
<em>Discussing, sketching and exchanging ideas with colleagues has proven to be very effective. Image by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flat61/3883611573/">Claire Murray</a>.</em></p>
<p>So, what I really wanted to know when I asked the question above was, what are the absolute must-haves in order to be successful with lean UX?</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favorite responses to “You’re not practicing lean UX if…,” along with my reasons why (in brackets):</p>
<p>From <a href="https://twitter.com/hpdailyrant">Ha Phan</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“… your collaboration sessions with the team don’t include business goals and strategies.”<br />
[As much as I want to focus on solving user problems, it won’t fly if we don’t consider where we are headed as a business and whether the activity fits in.]</li>
<li>“… you’re not defining KPIs [key performance indicators] and integrating analytics into each release.”<br />
[Without a valid measurement, we can’t know whether we’re solving the problem. We have to be able to point to at least one number to know whether we’re failing or succeeding.]</li>
<li>“<strong>… you implement every single step in the design process</strong>, instead of picking and choosing from the design toolbox.”<br />
[Lean UX is a set of principles and tools and should be applied as needed. We shouldn’t be ticking every box in a project management cycle.]</li>
<li>“… you’re creating long design specs for the vision of the entire product.”<br />
[Users do not interact with requirements documents, specifications and wireframes; so, the quicker we get to the end product, the better. Let’s not get bogged down by deliverables in the interim. Rather, let’s create the lightest thing we can in order to communicate how to apply the thinking to the end design.]</li>
</ul>
<p>From <a href="http://www.jeffgothelf.com/blog/">Jeff Gothelf</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“… you are not managing towards outcomes (not outputs, feature sets, etc).”<br />
[At the end of the day, we need to consider the bottom line. Sure, we’re building products, but more importantly, we’re building a business. Asking whether what we’re doing will make money is important? And if it will make money, how?]</li>
<li>“<strong>… you don’t have a willingness and the freedom or support to experiment.</strong>”<br />
[This can’t be done without executive buy-in.]</li>
</ul>
<p>From <a href="https://twitter.com/MelissaHui">Melissa Hui</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“… you’re spending more time working on documentation than thinking about the design and collaboration with team members.”<br />
[This is similar to what Ha said, but this identifies an interesting danger. Working on documentation tends to be a one-person activity that takes away from valuable collaboration.]</li>
<li>“… your development team is not seeing what they’re building until they have to build it.”<br />
[The development team should be fully engaged and involved in the design process. Again, collaboration is key.]</li>

<h3>The Lean UX Manifesto</h3>
<p>After receiving these responses, I felt compelled to create a manifesto. The responses helped me to focus on the guiding principles behind lean UX. I like the ones cited above because they focus not on a particular tool, but rather on the seeds of innovation behavior. After reading all of the tweets and emails and then thinking about the current toolset, I boiled down the manifesto to what follows below.</p>
<p>I didn’t do it alone. I enlisted the help of two colleagues who I also consider mentors: Ha Phan, quoted above, and Ajay Revels, my lean UX partner in crime. Visit the <a href="http://www.leanuxmanifesto.com/">Lean UX Manifesto website</a> for more of the back story.</p>
<p>So, here is what we believe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are developing a way to create digital experiences that are valued by our end users. Through this work, we hold in high regard the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early customer validation</strong> over releasing products with unknown end-user value</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative design</strong> over designing on an island</li>
<li><strong>Solving user problems</strong> over designing the next “cool” feature</li>
<li><strong>Measuring KPIs</strong> over undefined success metrics</li>
<li><strong>Applying appropriate tools</strong> over following a rigid plan</li>
<li><strong>Nimble design</strong> over heavy wireframes, comps or specs</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated in the Agile Manifesto, “While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How The Manifesto Works</h3>
<p>Let’s take each of these in turn and see how we can follow the principles of lean UX.</p>
<h4>Early Customer Validation Over Releasing Products With Unknown User Value</h4>
<p>What if you worked at a company where usability testing just wasn’t done? Unfortunately, this is the sad state in which many of our fellow UX practitioners find themselves. How, then, do they follow the principles of lean UX?</p>
<p>With usability testing, we seek customer validation or early failure. Customer validation may be sought through other means as well. For example, does your company gather feedback from users? If that feedback is circulated, are you on the list of people who receive it?</p>
<p>Here are other sources of learning about customer needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer service representatives</strong><br />
Their focus is on helping customers overcome experience issues. Try to speak to them regularly. They are likely documenting their calls, so see whether you can create some system for tagging experience issues that you can follow up on.</li>
<li><strong>Sales representatives</strong><br />
This is another group that is focused on the customer. They will understand what customer problems are out there to be solved. They’ll also know which features are important and which innovations customers want.</li>
<li><strong>Website search data</strong><br />
This is an invaluable source of customer desires. Search data can uncover website navigation problems and features or problems that customers are looking for.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Collaborative Design Over Designing on an Island</h4>
<p>Design should not be a solo exercise. Being a design team of one is no excuse. I use the <a href="http://vimeo.com/37861987">design studio process</a> and adopt the role of facilitator. Gather team members who own a piece of the project, and host a design studio workshop. Include at least the following people (adjusting to suit your unique organization):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain owner</strong><br />
Your subject matter expert</li>
<li><strong>Requirements Owner</strong><br />
A business analyst or the person who gathers and writes the requirements</li>
<li><strong>Data provider</strong><br />
A data analyst on hand who is familiar with the analytics and can pull the info you need</li>
<li><strong>Technology owner</strong><br />
A developer, someone who understands the technology constraints and design patterns</li>
<li><strong>Product or business owner</strong><br />
A product manager or the person who owns this piece of business</li>
<li><strong>Designer</strong><br />
The UX or visual designer or person who owns the design and can facilitate the design studio</li>
<li><strong>Researcher</strong><br />
The usability analyst or UX researcher or person who owns customer development and persona creation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solving User Problems Over Designing the Next Cool Feature</h4>
<p>When you’re handed a requirements document, a thought-out solution, a feature, a brief or whatever artifact you receive to inform your work, begin by asking, “What problem are we trying to solve?” Ideally, you should clearly understand the customer’s problem. Design is problem-solving, so if you don’t know the problem, you can’t design a solution. If you do this enough, then the stakeholders will understand that you’re more than just a wireframe jockey. You’re a professional problem-solver with a system for creating solutions that make sense.</p>
<h4>Measuring KPIs Over Undefined Success Metrics</h4>
<p>You can’t measure success if you aren’t… er, measuring. Avoid vanity metrics. I love <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version">Dave McClure’s pirate metrics</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquisitions</strong><br />
Users come to the website from various channels.</li>
<li><strong>Activation</strong><br />
Users enjoy their first visit (a “happy” user experience).</li>
<li><strong>Retention</strong><br />
Users come back, visiting multiple times.</li>
<li><strong>Referral</strong><br />
Users like the product enough to refer others.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong><br />
Users conduct some monetization behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Applying Appropriate Tools Over Following a Rigid Plan</h4>
<p>Lean UX should be a flexible process. As I started to develop the process steps for one cycle, I found myself overwhelmed with the number of tools being recommended. My advice, similar to what I’d say when creating a minimum viable product, is to apply the minimum tools required to get you to “pivot” or “persevere.”</p>
<p>Here are a few tools that I’ve found useful (not an exhaustive list):</p>
<ul>
<li>provisional personas, right sized for the effort;</li>
<li>persona map (which we learned from Menlo Innovations);</li>
<li>assumptions, with the riskiest identified;</li>
<li>design studio;</li>
<li>paper prototyping in early stages;</li>
<li>digital prototyping (HTML preferred) in later stages;</li>
<li>guerilla design assessment (a better name for usability testing);</li>
<li>co-location wherever possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DesignStudio.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DesignStudio.jpg" alt="The design studio method is popular for collaborative design" width="500" height="375" class="size-full wp-image-120154" /></a><br />
<em>The design studio method is popular for collaborative design. (Image: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/visualpunch/10306535683/in/photostream/"> visualpun.ch</a>)</em></p>
<p>Everything else should be applied as it makes sense. For example, if more customer development is needed, then take the time to interview as a team and to internalize customer needs. The lean startup world has no shortage of tools. Use only the ones that make sense to your project and that get you to a validated solution faster.</p>
<h4>Nimble Design Over Heavy Wireframes, Comps or Specs</h4>
<p>The goal is to release a product. Once it’s released, users won’t interact with the wireframes or requirements document as part of the product. They will interact with the product itself. So, try to spend less time on your design artifacts.</p>
<p>How can you lighten your wireframes?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lighter annotations and more presentation</strong><br />
I’ve found that if I take the time to present my unfinished wireframes to stakeholders, I will get valuable feedback sooner and save time.</li>
<li><strong>Co-design</strong><br />
If developers, quality assurance testers and business analysts are involved in the design, then they will share ownership and internalize the annotations. When this happens, you can pass off sketches as wireframes because team members will already understand the interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Paper prototypes</strong><br />
These serve a dual purpose. They get you to design validation (i.e. usability testing) sooner, but they also demonstrate the interactions. No need to write detailed wire annotations if the user can see the interactions firsthand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>It’s All About Principle-Driven Design</h3>
<p>This all boils down to something that I call principle-driven design. As stated, some lean UX is better than none, so applying these principles as best you can will get you to customer-validated, early-failure solutions more quickly. Rules are for practitioners who don’t really know the value of this process, while principles demand wisdom and maturity.</p>
<p>By allowing principles to drive you, you’ll find that you’re more nimble, reasonable and collaborative. Really, you’ll be overall better at getting to solutions. This will please your stakeholders and team members from other disciplines (development, visual design, business, etc.). To quote the late Stephen Covey:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There are three constants in life: change, choice and principles.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That pretty much sums up lean UX.</p>
